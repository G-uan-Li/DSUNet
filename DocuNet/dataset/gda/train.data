associated mutation in KVLQT1 and has deleterious effects on the KVLQT1 potassium channel , causing a frameshift and the truncation of the KVLQT1 protein .|In contrast to previous reports in which LQT was inherited as a clear dominant trait , 2 parents in the JLNS family described here have normal QTc intervals ( 0 . 43 and 0 . 44 seconds , respectively ) .|CONCLUSIONS : A novel homozygous KVLQT1 mutation causes JLNS in an Amish family with deafness that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	82-83	36-38	3753	KCNE1|minK|KCNE1	Gene	82:84:123	83:85:124	3:3:4	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	36	38	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	36-38	3757	HERG	Gene	88	89	3	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	36	38	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	36-38	3-4	3784	KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1	Gene	3:80:121:187:220:227:239:288	4:81:122:188:221:228:240:289	0:3:4:6:7:7:7:9	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	36	38	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	96-97	36-38	6331	SCN5A	Gene	96	97	3	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	36	38	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	123-124	110-111	3753	KCNE1|minK|KCNE1	Gene	82:84:123	83:85:124	3:3:4	D003638	deafness|deafness|deafness	Disease	110:203:297	111:204:298	4:6:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	110-111	88-89	3757	HERG	Gene	88	89	3	D003638	deafness|deafness|deafness	Disease	110:203:297	111:204:298	4:6:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	297-298	288-289	3784	KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1	Gene	3:80:121:187:220:227:239:288	4:81:122:188:221:228:240:289	0:3:4:6:7:7:7:9	D003638	deafness|deafness|deafness	Disease	110:203:297	111:204:298	4:6:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	110-111	96-97	6331	SCN5A	Gene	96	97	3	D003638	deafness|deafness|deafness	Disease	110:203:297	111:204:298	4:6:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	82-83	33-35	3753	KCNE1|minK|KCNE1	Gene	82:84:123	83:85:124	3:3:4	D003645	sudden death	Disease	33	35	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	33-35	3757	HERG	Gene	88	89	3	D003645	sudden death	Disease	33	35	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	33-35	3-4	3784	KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1	Gene	3:80:121:187:220:227:239:288	4:81:122:188:221:228:240:289	0:3:4:6:7:7:7:9	D003645	sudden death	Disease	33	35	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	96-97	33-35	6331	SCN5A	Gene	96	97	3	D003645	sudden death	Disease	33	35	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	82-83	24-26	3753	KCNE1|minK|KCNE1	Gene	82:84:123	83:85:124	3:3:4	D006331	cardiac disorder	Disease	24	26	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	24-26	3757	HERG	Gene	88	89	3	D006331	cardiac disorder	Disease	24	26	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	24-26	3-4	3784	KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1|KVLQT1	Gene	3:80:121:187:220:227:239:288	4:81:122:188:221:228:240:289	0:3:4:6:7:7:7:9	D006331	cardiac disorder	Disease	24	26	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	96-97	24-26	6331	SCN5A	Gene	96	97	3	D006331	cardiac disorder	Disease	24	26	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	129-131	123-124	3753	KCNE1|minK|KCNE1	Gene	82:84:123	83:85:124	3:3:4	D008133	Long -

10197076	A cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen - 4 ( CTLA - 4 ) gene polymorphism is associated with autoimmune Addison 's disease in English patients .|OBJECTIVE : Recent studies have demonstrated an association between a microsatellite polymorphism of the CTLA - 4 gene , specifically a 106 base pair allele , and both Graves ' disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism .|The aim of the present study was to determine whether the same polymorphism of the CTLA - 4 gene was associated with autoimmune Addison 's disease .|DESIGN AND PATIENTS : We analysed a microsatellite polymorphism ( variant lengths of a dinucleotide ( AT ) n repeat ) within exon 3 of the CTLA - 4 gene in the following groups : 21 English patients with non - associated Addison 's disease , 18 with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 ( APS2 ) and 173 healthy control subjects ; 26 Norwegian patients with non - associated Addison 's disease , 9 with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 ( APS1 ) , 17 with APS2 and 100 controls ; 3 Finnish patients with non - associated Addison 's disease , 5 with APS2 and 71 controls ; 10 Estonian patients with non - associated Addison 's disease , 2 with APS2 and 45 controls .|MEASUREMENTS : The CTLA - 4 microsatellite gene polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and resolution of the products on sequencing gels .|RESULTS : The frequency of the 106 base pair allele was significantly increased in the groups of English patients with either non - associated Addison 's disease or APS2 ( P = 0 . 02 and 0 . 04 , respectively ) , when compared to healthy controls with no clinical evidence or family history of either Addison 's disease or any other autoimmune disorder .|For Norwegian patients with either non - associated Addison 's disease , APS1 or APS2 , there was no association ( P = 0 . 69 , 0 . 62 and 0 . 97 , respectively ) .|This was also the case for Finnish patients with either non - associated Addison 's disease or APS2 ( P = 0 . 23 and 0 . 28 , respectively ) and for Estonian patients with either non - associated Addison 's disease or APS2 ( P = 0 . 34 and 0 . 29 , respectively ) .|CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that differences exist in the frequency of the 106 base pair allele in different population groups and in only the English population was the 106 base pair allele associated with Addison 's disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-140	57-59	170685	autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2|APS2|APS2|APS2|APS2|APS2|APS2|APS2|APS2	Gene	135:141:173:191:209:270:363:390:322	140:142:174:192:210:271:364:391:323	3:3:3:3:3:5:7:7:6	C562768	autoimmune hypothyroidism	Disease	57	59	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	162-167	57-59	326	autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1|APS1	Gene	162:168	167:169	3:3	C562768	autoimmune hypothyroidism	Disease	57	59	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	75-78	57-59	1493	cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen -

10204114	Molecular biology of adenosine triphosphate - sensitive potassium channels .|KATP channels are a newly defined class of potassium channels based on the physical association of an ABC protein , the sulfonylurea receptor , and a K + inward rectifier subunit .|The beta - cell KATP channel is composed of SUR1 , the high - affinity sulfonylurea receptor with multiple TMDs and two NBFs , and KIR6 . 2 , a weak inward rectifier , in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry .|The pore of the channel is formed by KIR6 . 2 in a tetrameric arrangement ; the overall stoichiometry of active channels is ( SUR1 / KIR6 . 2 ) 4 .|The two subunits form a tightly integrated whole .|KIR6 . 2 can be expressed in the plasma membrane either by deletion of an ER retention signal at its C - terminal end or by high - level expression to overwhelm the retention mechanism .|The single - channel conductance of the homomeric KIR6 . 2 channels is equivalent to SUR / KIR6 . 2 channels , but they differ in all other respects , including bursting behavior , pharmacological properties , sensitivity to ATP and ADP , and trafficking to the plasma membrane .|Coexpression with SUR restores the normal channel properties .|The key role KATP channel play in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to changes in glucose metabolism is underscored by the finding that a recessive form of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy ( PHHI ) is caused by mutations in KATP channel subunits that result in the loss of channel activity .|KATP channels set the resting membrane potential of beta - cells , and their loss results in a constitutive depolarization that allows voltage - gated Ca2 + channels to open spontaneously , increasing the cytosolic Ca2 + levels enough to trigger continuous release of insulin .|The loss of KATP channels , in effect , uncouples the electrical activity of beta - cells from their metabolic activity .|PHHI mutations have been informative on the function of SUR1 and regulation of KATP channels by adenine nucleotides .|The results indicate that SUR1 is important in sensing nucleotide changes , as implied by its sequence similarity to other ABC proteins , in addition to being the drug sensor .|An unexpected finding is that the inhibitory action of ATP appears to be through a site located on KIR6 . 2 , whose affinity for ATP is modified by SUR1 .|A PHHI mutation , G1479R , in the second NBF of SUR1 forms active KATP channels that respond normally to ATP , but fail to activate with MgADP .|The result implies that ATP tonically inhibits KATP channels , but that the ADP level in a fasting beta - cell antagonizes this inhibition .|Decreases in the ADP level as glucose is metabolized result in KATP channel closure .|Although KATP channels are the target for sulfonylureas used in the treatment of NIDDM , the available data suggest that the identified KATP channel mutations do not play a major role in diabetes .|Understanding how KATP channels fit into the overall scheme of glucose homeostasis , on the other hand , promises insight into diabetes and other disorders of glucose metabolism , while understanding the structure and regulation of these channels offers potential for development of novel compounds to regulate cellular electrical activity .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	523-524	409-412	3767	KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2	Gene	67:91:109:124:168:177:409	70:94:112:127:171:180:412	2:3:3:5:6:6:13	D003920	diabetes|diabetes	Disease	523:546	524:547	17:18	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	523-524	433-434	6833	SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1	Gene	51:107:350:364:420:433	52:108:351:365:421:434	2:3:11:12:13:14	D003920	diabetes|diabetes	Disease	523:546	524:547	17:18	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	504-505	409-412	3767	KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2	Gene	67:91:109:124:168:177:409	70:94:112:127:171:180:412	2:3:3:5:6:6:13	D003924	NIDDM	Disease	504	505	17	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	504-505	433-434	6833	SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1	Gene	51:107:350:364:420:433	52:108:351:365:421:434	2:3:11:12:13:14	D003924	NIDDM	Disease	504	505	17	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	549-553	409-412	3767	KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2	Gene	67:91:109:124:168:177:409	70:94:112:127:171:180:412	2:3:3:5:6:6:13	D044882	disorders of glucose metabolism	Disease	549	553	18	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	549-553	433-434	6833	SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1	Gene	51:107:350:364:420:433	52:108:351:365:421:434	2:3:11:12:13:14	D044882	disorders of glucose metabolism	Disease	549	553	18	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	423-424	409-412	3767	KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2|KIR6 . 2	Gene	67:91:109:124:168:177:409	70:94:112:127:171:180:412	2:3:3:5:6:6:13	D044903	persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy|PHHI|PHHI|PHHI	Disease	248:254:341:423	253:255:342:424	8:8:11:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	423-424	420-421	6833	SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1|SUR1	Gene	51:107:350:364:420:433	52:108:351:365:421:434	2:3:11:12:13:14	D044903	persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy|PHHI|PHHI|PHHI	Disease	248:254:341:423	253:255:342:424	8:8:11:14

systemic shunting of venous blood .|PSE is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure .|Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from PSE patients as well as in experimental animal models of PSE reveal that chronic liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability .|Such alterations include increased expression of monoamine oxidase ( MAO - A isoform ) , the " peripheral - type " benzodiazepine receptor ( PTBR ) as well as constitutive , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) .|Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters , increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties and increased production of nitric oxide ( respectively ) in brain in chronic liver failure .|In the case of PTBR and nNOS , increases in expression result from exposure to ammonia and / or manganese , two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in chronic liver failure .|Further elucidation of the consequences of neurotransmitter -

10508514	Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X - linked MECP2 , encoding methyl - CpG - binding protein 2 .|Rett syndrome ( RTT , MIM 312750 ) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females , with an incidence of 1 in 10 , 000 - 15 , 000 ( ref .|2 ) .|Patients with classic RTT appear to develop normally until 6 - 18 months of age , then gradually lose speech and purposeful hand use , and develop microcephaly , seizures , autism , ataxia , intermittent hyperventilation and stereotypic hand movements .|After initial regression , the condition stabilizes and patients usually survive into adulthood .|As RTT occurs almost exclusively in females , it has been proposed that RTT is caused by an X - linked dominant mutation with lethality in hemizygous males .|Previous exclusion mapping studies using RTT families mapped the locus to Xq28 ( refs 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) .|Using a systematic gene screening approach , we have identified mutations in the gene ( MECP2 ) encoding X - linked methyl - CpG - binding protein 2 ( MeCP2 ) as the cause of some cases of RTT .|MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A ( refs 12 , 13 ) .|In 5 of 21 sporadic patients , we found 3 de novo missense mutations in the region encoding the highly conserved methyl - binding domain ( MBD ) as well as a de novo frameshift and a de novo nonsense mutation , both of which disrupt the transcription repression domain ( TRD ) .|In two affected half - sisters of a RTT family , we found segregation of an additional missense mutation not detected in their obligate carrier mother .|This suggests that the mother is a germline mosaic for this mutation .|Our study reports the first disease - causing mutations in RTT and points to abnormal epigenetic regulation as the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RTT .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	264-268	235-236	25942	SIN3A	Gene	235	236	8	C535434	methyl -

10544980	Norrie disease and exudative vitreoretinopathy in families with affected female carriers .|PURPOSE : Norrie disease ( ND ) is a rare X - linked recessive disorder characterized by congenital blindness , which is often associated with sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation .|X - linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy ( FEVR ) is a hereditary disorder characterized by an abnormality of the peripheral retina and is not associated with systemic diseases .|X - linked recessive disorders generally do not affect females .|Here we show that female carriers can be associated with manifestation of an X - linked disorder .|METHODS : A four - generation family with an affected female , and a history of congenital blindness and hearing loss , was identified through the pro - band .|A second family , with a full - term female infant , was evaluated through ophthalmic examinations and found to exhibit ocular features , such as retinal folds , retinal detachment and peripheral exudates .|Peripheral blood specimens were collected from several affected and unaffected family members .|DNA was extracted and analyzed by single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) following polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification of the exons of the Norrie disease gene .|The amplified products were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method .|RESULTS : In an X - linked four - generation family , a novel missense ( A118D ) mutation in the third exon of the Norrie disease gene , was identified .|The mutation was transmitted through three generations and cosegregated with the disease .|The affected maternal grandmother and the unaffected mother carried the same mutation in one of their alleles .|In an unrelated sporadic family , a heterozygous missense mutation ( C96Y ) was identified in the third exon of the Norrie disease gene in an affected individual .|Analysis of exon - 1 and 2 of the Norrie disease gene did not reveal any additional sequence alterations in these families .|The mutations were not detected in the unaffected family members and the 116 normal unrelated controls , suggesting that they are likely to be the pathogenic mutations .|CONCLUSIONS : The results further strengthen the proposal that X - linked disorders can occur in female carriers , due likely to an unfavorable X - inactivation .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	51-52	29-31	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	C536600	congenital blindness|congenital blindness	Disease	29:118	31:120	1:5	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	51-52	17-18	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	C537849	Norrie disease|Norrie disease|ND|Norrie disease|Norrie disease|Norrie disease|Norrie disease	Disease	0:14:17:207:248:307:324	2:16:18:209:250:309:326	0:1:1:8:10:13:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	51-52	51-52	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	C580083	familial exudative vitreoretinopathy|FEVR	Disease	47:51	50:52	2:2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	37-40	51-52	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D006319	sensorineural hearing loss	Disease	37	40	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	41-43	51-52	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D008607	mental retardation	Disease	41	43	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	51-52	161-163	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D012163	retinal detachment	Disease	161	163	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	4-5	51-52	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D018630	vitreoretinopathy	Disease	4	5	0	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	51-52	55-57	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D030342	hereditary disorder	Disease	55	57	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	51-52	121-123	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D034381	hearing loss	Disease	121	123	5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	51-52	70-72	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D034721	systemic diseases	Disease	70	72	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	51-52	73-78	4693	FEVR	Gene	51	52	2	D040181	X - linked recessive disorder|X - linked recessive disorders|X - linked disorder|X - linked disorders	Disease	22:73:97:375	27:78:101:379	1:3:4:16
10545420	Strain - dependent lung tumor formation in mice transplacentally exposed to 3 - methylcholanthrene and post - natally exposed to butylated hydroxytoluene .|The carcinogenic effects of in utero exposure to 3 -

10602775	Identification and expression of mutations in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene causing acute intermittent porphyria ( AIP ) .|BACKGROUND : Acute intermittent porphyria ( AIP ) , an autosomal dominant inborn error , results from the half - normal activity of the heme biosynthetic enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase ( EC 4 . 3 . 1 . 8 ; HMB - synthase ) .|This disease is characterized by acute , life - threatening neurologic attacks that are precipitated by various drugs , hormones , and other factors .|The enzymatic and / or biochemical diagnosis of AIP heterozygotes is problematic ; therefore , efforts have focused on the identification of HMB - synthase mutations so that heterozygotes can be identified and educated to avoid the precipitating factors .|In Spain , the occurrence of AIP has been reported , but the nature of the HMB - synthase mutations causing AIP in Spanish families has not been investigated .|Molecular analysis was therefore undertaken in nine unrelated Spanish AIP patients .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Genomic DNA was isolated from affected probands and family members of nine unrelated Spanish families with AIP .|The HMB - synthase gene was amplified by long - range PCR and the nucleotide sequence of each exon was determined by cycle sequencing .|RESULTS : Three new mutations , a missense , M212V ; a single base insertion , g4715insT ; and a deletion / insertion , g7902ACT - - > G , as well as five previously reported mutations ( G111R , R116W , R149X R167W , and R173W ) were detected in the Spanish probands .|Expression of the novel missense mutation M212V in E . coli revealed that the mutation was causative , having < 2 % residual activity .|CONCLUSIONS : These studies identified the first mutations in the HMB - synthase gene causing AIP in Spanish patients .|Three of the mutations were novel , while five previously reported lesions were found in six Spanish families .|These findings enable accurate identification and counseling of presymptomatic carriers in these nine unrelated Spanish AIP families and further demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of mutations causing AIP .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	11-14	7-9	3145	hydroxymethylbilane synthase|hydroxymethylbilane synthase	Gene	7:45	9:47	0:1	D017118	acute intermittent porphyria|AIP|Acute intermittent porphyria|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP|AIP	Disease	11:15:20:24:95:133:148:166:189:311:350:361	14:16:23:25:96:134:149:167:190:312:351:362	0:0:1:1:3:4:4:5:6:10:12:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	45-47	28-32	3145	hydroxymethylbilane synthase|hydroxymethylbilane synthase	Gene	7:45	9:47	0:1	D030342	autosomal dominant inborn error	Disease	28	32	1
10604740	Gain of chromosome arm 17q is associated with unfavourable prognosis in neuroblastoma , but does not involve mutations in the somatostatin receptor 2 ( SSTR2 ) gene at 17q24 .|Deletion of chromosome arm 1p and amplification of the MYCN oncogene are well - recognized genetic alterations in neuroblastoma cells .|Recently , another alteration has been reported ; gain of the distal part of chromosome arm 17q .|In this study 48 neuroblastoma tumours were successfully analysed for 17q status in relation to known genetic alterations .|Chromosome 17 status was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .|Thirty - one of the 48 neuroblastomas ( 65 % ) showed 17q gain , and this was significantly associated with poor prognosis .|As previously reported , 17q gain was significantly associated with metastatic stage 4 neuroblastoma and more frequently detected than both deletion of chromosome arm 1p and MYCN amplification in tumours of all stages .|17q gain also showed a strong correlation to survival probability ( P = 0 . 0009 ) .|However , the most significant correlation between 17q gain and survival probability was observed in children with low - stage tumours ( stage 1 , 2 , 3 and 4S ) , with a survival probability of 100 % at 5 years from diagnosis for children with tumours showing no 17q gain compared to 52 . 5 % for those showing 17q gain ( P = 0 . 0021 ) .|This suggests that 17q gain as a prognostic factor plays a more crucial role in low - stage tumours .|Expression of the somatostatin receptor 2 ( SSTR2 ) , localized in chromosome region 17q24 , has in previous studies been shown to be positively related to survival in neuroblastoma .|A point mutation in the SSTR2 gene has earlier been reported in a human small - cell lung cancer .|In this study , mutation screening of the SSTR2 gene in 43 neuroblastoma tumours was carried out with polymerase chain reaction - based single - stranded conformation polymorphism / heteroduplex ( SSCP / HD ) and DNA sequencing , and none of the tumours showed any aberrations in the SSTR2 gene .|These data suggest that mutations in the SSTR2 gene are uncommon in neuroblastoma tumours and do not correlate with either the 17q gain often seen or the reason some tumours do not express SSTR2 receptors .|Overall , this study indicates that gain of chromosome arm 17q is the most frequently occurring genetic alteration , and that it is associated with established prognostic factors .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	353-354	149-151	11047	arm 1p|arm 1p	Gene	33:149	35:151	1:6	D006816	HD	Disease	353	354	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	353-354	152-153	4613	MYCN|MYCN	Gene	39:152	40:153	1:6	D006816	HD	Disease	353	354	12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	369-370	353-354	6752	somatostatin receptor 2|SSTR2|somatostatin receptor 2|SSTR2|SSTR2|SSTR2|SSTR2|SSTR2|SSTR2	Gene	20:24:272:276:305:328:369:379:405	23:25:275:277:306:329:370:380:406	0:0:10:10:11:12:12:13:13	D006816	HD	Disease	353	354	12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	155-156	149-151	11047	arm 1p|arm 1p	Gene	33:149	35:151	1:6	D009369	neuroblastoma tumours|tumours|low -

myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) , and cardiotrophin ( CT ) - 1 genes .|The animals were injected i . p .|with 15 mg / kg doxorubicin ( Dox ) , an antineoplastic drug with restricted use because of its cardiotoxicity .|The survival rates after 10 days were 25 % ( 5 / 20 ) for control littermates ( WT ) , but 80 % ( 16 / 20 ) for STAT3 -

10652017	Risk of advanced diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism .|Risk of advanced diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism .|BACKGROUND : Polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene ( eNOS ) may be implicated in the development of nephropathy in patients with type 1 or insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) .|METHODS : Three groups of IDDM patients were selected to study this hypothesis : cases with advanced diabetic nephropathy ( N = 78 ) , cases with overt proteinuria but normal serum creatinine ( N = 74 ) , and controls with normoalbuminuria despite 15 years of diabetes ( N = 195 ) .|Parents of 132 cases and 53 controls were also examined and were used for the transmission disequilibrium test , a family - based study design to test association .|RESULTS : We examined four eNOS polymorphisms , and two were associated with diabetic nephropathy in the case - control comparisons : a T to C substitution in the promoter at position - 786 and the a - deletion / b - insertion in intron 4 .|For the former , the risk of developing advanced nephropathy was higher for C allele homozygotes than for the other two genotypes ( odds ratio 2 . 8 , 95 % CI , 1 . 4 to 5 . 6 ) .|For the latter polymorphism , it was the a - deletion carriers that had the higher risk ( odds ratio 2 . 3 , 95 % CI , 1 . 3 to 4 . 0 ) in comparison with noncarriers .|Both polymorphisms were analyzed together as haplotypes in a family - based study using the transmission disequilibrium test .|The C / a - deletion haplotype was transmitted from heterozygous parents to cases with advanced diabetic nephropathy with a significantly higher frequency than expected ( P = 0 . 004 ) .|CONCLUSION : The findings of the case - control and family - based studies demonstrate clearly that DNA sequence differences in eNOS influence the risk of advanced nephropathy in type 1 diabetes .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	12-16	8-9	4846	endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|eNOS|eNOS|eNOS	Gene	12:31:43:49:162:360	16:35:47:50:163:361	0:1:2:2:5:10	D003920	diabetes|diabetes|diabetes|diabetes	Disease	8:27:121:370	9:28:122:371	0:1:3:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	65-70	49-50	4846	endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|eNOS|eNOS|eNOS	Gene	12:31:43:49:162:360	16:35:47:50:163:361	0:1:2:2:5:10	D003922	insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus|IDDM|IDDM	Disease	65:71:79	70:72:80	2:2:3	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-35	22-24	4846	endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|eNOS|eNOS|eNOS	Gene	12:31:43:49:162:360	16:35:47:50:163:361	0:1:2:2:5:10	D003928	diabetic nephropathy|diabetic nephropathy|diabetic nephropathy|diabetic nephropathy|diabetic nephropathy	Disease	3:22:91:170:322	5:24:93:172:324	0:1:3:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	366-367	360-361	4846	endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|eNOS|eNOS|eNOS	Gene	12:31:43:49:162:360	16:35:47:50:163:361	0:1:2:2:5:10	D007674	nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy	Disease	58:213:366	59:214:367	2:6:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	102-103	49-50	4846	endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|endothelial nitric oxide synthase|eNOS|eNOS|eNOS	Gene	12:31:43:49:162:360	16:35:47:50:163:361	0:1:2:2:5:10	D011507	proteinuria	Disease	102	103	3

10657949	Cyclooxygenase - 2 expression in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas .|Cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) expression is up - regulated in several types of human cancers and has also been directly linked to carcinogenesis .|To investigate the role of COX - 2 in pancreatic cancer , we evaluated COX - 2 protein expression in primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas ( n = 23 ) and matched normal adjacent tissue ( n = 11 ) by immunoblot analysis .|COX - 2 expression was found to be significantly elevated in the pancreatic tumor specimens compared with normal pancreatic tissue .|To examine whether the elevated levels of COX - 2 protein observed in pancreatic tumors correlated with the presence of oncogenic K - ras , we determined the K - ras mutation status in a subset of the tumors and corresponding normal tissues .|The presence of oncogenic K - ras did not correlate with the level of COX - 2 protein expressed in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas analyzed .|These observations were also confirmed in a panel of human pancreatic tumor cell lines .|Furthermore , in the pancreatic tumor cell line expressing the highest level of COX - 2 ( BxPC - 3 ) , COX - 2 expression was demonstrated to be independent of Erk1 / 2 activation .|The lack of correlation between COX - 2 and oncogenic K - ras expression suggests that Ras activation may not be sufficient to induce COX - 2 expression in pancreatic tumor cells and that the aberrant activation of signaling pathways other than Ras may be required for up - regulating COX - 2 expression .|We also report that the COX inhibitors sulindac , indomethacin and NS - 398 inhibit cell growth in both COX - 2 - positive ( BxPC - 3 ) and COX - 2 - negative ( PaCa - 2 ) pancreatic tumor cell lines .|However , suppression of cell growth by indomethacin and NS - 398 was significantly greater in the BxPC - 3 cell line compared with the PaCa - 2 cell line ( P = 0 . 004 and P < 0 . 001 , respectively ) .|In addition , the three COX inhibitors reduce prostaglandin E ( 2 ) levels in the BxPC - 3 cell line .|Taken together , our data suggest that COX - 2 may play an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis and therefore be a promising chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	139-140	129-132	3845	K - ras|K -

10663555	Analysis of single - nucleotide polymorphisms in the interleukin - 4 receptor gene for association with inflammatory bowel disease .|Genetic linkage analysis in families with multiple cases of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) has mapped a gene which confers susceptibility to IBD to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16 ( IBD1 ) .|The linked region includes the interleukin ( IL ) - 4 receptor gene ( IL4R ) .|Since IL - 4 regulation and expression are abnormal in IBD , the IL4R gene is thus both a positional and functional candidate for IBD1 .|We screened the gene for single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) by fluorescent chemical cleavage analysis , and tested a subset of known and novel SNPs for allelic association with IBD in 355 families , which included 435 cases of Crohn 's disease and 329 cases of ulcerative colitis .|No association was observed between a haplotype of four SNPs ( val50ile , gln576arg , A3044G , G3289A ) and either the Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis phenotypes using the transmission disequilibrium test .|There was also no evidence for association when the four markers were analyzed individually .|The results indicate that these variants are not significant genetic determinants of IBD , and that the IL4R gene is unlikely to be IBD1 .|Linkage disequilibrium analyses showed that the val50ile and gln576arg variants are in complete equilibrium with each other , although they are separated by only about 21 kilobases of genomic DNA .|This suggests that a very dense SNP map may be required to exclude or detect disease associations with some candidate genes .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	222-223	175-177	130589	IBD1|IBD1|IBD1	Gene	52:96:222	53:97:223	1:3:7	D003093	ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis	Disease	146:175	148:177	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	146-148	73-76	3565	interleukin - 4|IL - 4	Gene	8:73	11:76	0:3	D003093	ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis	Disease	146:175	148:177	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	216-217	175-177	3566	interleukin ( IL ) - 4 receptor|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	60:69:85:216	67:70:86:217	2:2:3:7	D003093	ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis	Disease	146:175	148:177	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	139-142	96-97	130589	IBD1|IBD1|IBD1	Gene	52:96:222	53:97:223	1:3:7	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	139:171	142:174	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	139-142	73-76	3565	interleukin - 4|IL - 4	Gene	8:73	11:76	0:3	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	139:171	142:174	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	216-217	171-174	3566	interleukin ( IL ) - 4 receptor|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	60:69:85:216	67:70:86:217	2:2:3:7	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	139:171	142:174	4:5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	52-53	43-44	130589	IBD1|IBD1|IBD1	Gene	52:96:222	53:97:223	1:3:7	D015212	inflammatory bowel disease|inflammatory bowel disease|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD	Disease	16:29:33:43:82:129:211	19:32:34:44:83:130:212	0:1:1:1:3:4:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	82-83	73-76	3565	interleukin - 4|IL - 4	Gene	8:73	11:76	0:3	D015212	inflammatory bowel disease|inflammatory bowel disease|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD	Disease	16:29:33:43:82:129:211	19:32:34:44:83:130:212	0:1:1:1:3:4:7	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	85-86	82-83	3566	interleukin ( IL ) - 4 receptor|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	60:69:85:216	67:70:86:217	2:2:3:7	D015212	inflammatory bowel disease|inflammatory bowel disease|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD|IBD	Disease	16:29:33:43:82:129:211	19:32:34:44:83:130:212	0:1:1:1:3:4:7

10760079	Association between high von willebrand factor levels and the Thr789Ala vWF gene polymorphism but not with nephropathy in type I diabetes .|The GENEDIAB Study Group and the DESIR Study Group .|BACKGROUND : A genetic susceptibility for diabetic kidney disease is suspected since diabetic nephropathy occurs in only 30 to 40 % of type I diabetic patients .|As elevated von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) plasma concentrations have been reported to precede the development of microalbuminuria in type I diabetes , we addressed a possible implication of vWF as a genetic determinant for diabetic nephropathy .|METHODS : Three known vWF gene polymorphisms were genotyped in a group of 493 type I diabetic subjects , all showing proliferative retinopathy , but with various stages of renal involvement , which ranged from no microalbuminuria , despite a mean duration of diabetes of 31 years , to advanced nephropathy ( GENEDIAB Study ) : Thr789Ala ( Rsa I ) , M - / M + ( Msp I ) ( intron 19 ) , and Ala1381Thr ( Hph I ) .|Plasma vWF and factor VIII ( F VIII ) levels were also measured in this population .|RESULTS : Plasma vWF and F VIII levels were increased in diabetic subjects with nephropathy ( P < 0 . 001 ) or with coronary heart disease ( CHD ;

10781519	A novel keratin 12 mutation in a German kindred with Meesmann 's corneal dystrophy .|AIM : To study a kindred with Meesmann 's corneal dystrophy ( MCD ) to determine if a mutation within the cornea specific K3 or K12 genes is responsible for the disease phenotype .|METHODS : Slit lamp examination of the cornea in four members of the kindred was carried out to confirm the diagnosis of MCD .|The region encoding the helix initiation motif ( HIM ) of the K12 polypeptide was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified from genomic DNA derived from affected individuals in the kindred .|PCR products generated were subjected to direct automated sequencing .|Restriction enzyme analysis employing Ban I was used to confirm the presence of the mutation in affected individuals of the family .|RESULTS : Sequencing of the K12 gene in an affected individual from the family revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation ( 413A - - > C ) , predicting the substitution of a proline for a glutamine at codon 130 ( Q130P ) in the HIM of the K12 protein .|The mutation was excluded from 50 normal , unaffected individuals by restriction enyzme analysis and was therefore unlikely to be a common polymorphism .|CONCLUSION : A novel missense mutation in the K12 gene leads to MCD in a German kindred .|Missense mutations have now been identified within the region encoding the helix initiation motif of the K12 protein in eight of 11 MCD kindreds analysed at the molecular level .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	225-226	221-222	3859	keratin 12|K12|K12|K12|K12|K12|K12	Gene	2:40:85:143:186:221:247	4:41:86:144:187:222:248	0:1:3:6:6:8:9	D053559	Meesmann 's corneal dystrophy|Meesmann 's corneal dystrophy|MCD|MCD|MCD|MCD	Disease	10:22:27:71:225:253	14:26:28:72:226:254	0:1:1:2:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	40-41	36-37	3859	keratin 12|K12|K12|K12|K12|K12|K12	Gene	2:40:85:143:186:221:247	4:41:86:144:187:222:248	0:1:3:6:6:8:9	D065306	cornea|cornea	Disease	36:56	37:57	1:2

Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( AD - EDMD ) has recently been mapped and the corresponding gene identified .|AD - ADMD is characterized by early contractures of elbows and Achilles tendons and a humero - peroneal distribution of weakness combined with a cardiomyopathy with conduction defects .|The disease gene of AD - EDMD is LMNA which encodes lamins A / C , two proteins of the nuclear envelope .|In order to identify whether or not LGMD1B and AD - EDMD are allelic disorders , we carried out a search for mutations in the LMNA gene in patients with LGMD1B .|For this , PCR / SSCP / sequencing screening was carried out for the 12 exons of LMNA on DNA samples of individuals from three LGMD1B families that were linked to chromo -

10817561	Microsatellites and intragenic polymorphisms of transforming growth factor beta and platelet - derived growth factor and their receptor genes in Native Americans with systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) : a preliminary analysis showing no genetic association .|OBJECTIVE : Abnormalities of transforming growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) alpha and beta and / or their receptors have been demonstrated in systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) .|This study aimed to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in or near the TGFbeta and PDGF gene families were associated with susceptibility to SSc in a Native American population with a high disease prevalence .|METHODS : Genotyping of 5 intragenic polymorphisms within the TGFbeta1 gene and mapping of 35 microsatellites near the genes for TGFbeta1 , latent TGFbeta1 binding protein ( LTBP1 ) , TGFbeta receptors I and II , PDGFalpha , PDGFbeta , PDGF receptor alpha , and PDGF receptor beta was performed in 19 SSc patients , 76 controls , and 42 family members .|Allele distributions and frequencies were examined between SSc patients and controls , and marker haplotypes were examined in families when allele frequencies appeared to be different between patients and controls .|RESULTS : Although 1 polymorphism within the TGFbeta1 gene ( TGFbeta1 ) was modestly increased in the SSc patients , this did not maintain statistical significance after correction .|Similarly , 1 microsatellite ( D9S120 ) near the TGFbeta receptor I gene ( TGFBR1 ) showed a significant disturbance of allele frequencies between patients and controls ; however , it did not form a disease - associated haplotype with other nearby markers .|Weak disturbances of markers near PDGFalpha ( PDGFA ) and PDGFbeta , ( PDGFB ) also failed to maintain significance after correction .|Both PDGF receptor genes ( PDGFRA and PDGFRB ) also showed no disease associations .|CONCLUSION : The results of these preliminary analyses suggest that genetic anomalies of the TGFbeta1 and PDGF gene families are not likely to explain the dysregulation seen in SSc or to account for the susceptibility to SSc in this population .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	118-119	26-27	4052	TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|LTBP1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1	Gene	118:129:132:136:210:213:328	119:130:133:137:211:214:329	3:3:3:3:5:5:9	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	145-146	26-27	5154	PDGFalpha|PDGFalpha|PDGFA	Gene	145:281:283	146:282:284	3:7:7	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-148	26-27	5155	PDGFbeta|PDGFbeta|PDGFB	Gene	147:286:289	148:287:290	3:7:7	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	304-305	26-27	5156	PDGFRA	Gene	304	305	8	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	306-307	26-27	5159	PDGFRB	Gene	306	307	8	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	41-45	26-27	7040	transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor beta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta	Gene	5:41:46:87:139:241	9:45:47:88:140:242	0:1:1:2:3:6	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-247	26-27	7046	TGFBR1	Gene	246	247	6	D012594	scleroderma	Disease	26	27	0	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	220-221	213-214	4052	TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|LTBP1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1	Gene	118:129:132:136:210:213:328	119:130:133:137:211:214:329	3:3:3:3:5:5:9	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	161-162	145-146	5154	PDGFalpha|PDGFalpha|PDGFA	Gene	145:281:283	146:282:284	3:7:7	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	161-162	147-148	5155	PDGFbeta|PDGFbeta|PDGFB	Gene	147:286:289	148:287:290	3:7:7	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	342-343	304-305	5156	PDGFRA	Gene	304	305	8	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	342-343	306-307	5159	PDGFRB	Gene	306	307	8	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	97-98	87-88	7040	transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor beta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta	Gene	5:41:46:87:139:241	9:45:47:88:140:242	0:1:1:2:3:6	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-247	220-221	7046	TGFBR1	Gene	246	247	6	D012595	systemic sclerosis|systemic sclerosis|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc|SSc	Disease	23:69:72:97:161:179:220:342:350	25:71:73:98:162:180:221:343:351	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	328-329	324-326	4052	TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|LTBP1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1|TGFbeta1	Gene	118:129:132:136:210:213:328	119:130:133:137:211:214:329	3:3:3:3:5:5:9	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	283-284	5154	PDGFalpha|PDGFalpha|PDGFA	Gene	145:281:283	146:282:284	3:7:7	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	289-290	5155	PDGFbeta|PDGFbeta|PDGFB	Gene	147:286:289	148:287:290	3:7:7	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	304-305	5156	PDGFRA	Gene	304	305	8	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	306-307	5159	PDGFRB	Gene	306	307	8	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	241-242	7040	transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor beta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta|TGFbeta	Gene	5:41:46:87:139:241	9:45:47:88:140:242	0:1:1:2:3:6	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	324-326	246-247	7046	TGFBR1	Gene	246	247	6	D030342	genetic anomalies	Disease	324	326	9

10839995	Characterization of beta - galactosidase mutations Asp332 - - > Asn and Arg148 - - > Ser , and a polymorphism , Ser532 - - > Gly , in a case of GM1 gangliosidosis .|We have identified and characterized three missense mutations in a patient with type 1 G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis , namely a substitution of G for A at nucleotide position 1044 ( G1044 - - > A ; in exon 10 ) on one allele , which converts Asp ( 332 ) into asparagine , and both a mutation ( C492 - - > A in exon 4 , leading to the amino acid change of Arg ( 148 ) - - > Ser ) and a polymorphism ( A1644 - - > G in exon 15 , leading to a change of Ser ( 532 ) - - > Gly ) on the other allele .|This patient had less than 1 % residual beta - galactosidase activity and minimally detectable levels of immunoreactive beta - galactosidase protein in fibroblasts .|To account for the above findings , a series of expression and immunolocalization studies were undertaken to assess the impact of each mutation .|Transient overexpression in COS - 1 cells of cDNAs encoding Asp ( 332 ) Asn , Arg ( 148 ) Ser and Ser ( 532 ) Gly mutant beta - galactosidases produced abundant amounts of precursor beta - galactosidase , with activities of 0 , 84 and 81 % compared with the cDNA clone for wild - type beta - galactosidase ( GP8 ) .|Since the level of vector - driven expression is much less in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells than in COS - 1 cells , and we knew that exogenous beta - galactosidase undergoes lysosomal processing when expressed in these cells , transient expression studies were performed of Arg ( 148 ) Ser and Ser ( 532 ) Gly , which yielded active forms of the enzyme .|In this case , the Arg ( 148 ) Ser and Ser ( 532 ) Gly products gave rise to 11 % and 86 % of the control activity respectively .|These results were not unexpected , since the Arg ( 148 ) Ser mutation introduced a major conformational change into the protein , and we anticipated that it would be degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , whereas the polymorphism was expected to produce near - normal activity .|To examine the effect of the Asp ( 332 ) Asn mutation on the catalytic activity , we isolated CHO clones permanently transfected with the Asp ( 332 ) Asn and Asp ( 332 ) Glu constructs , purified the enzymes by substrate - analogue - affinity chromatography , and determined their kinetic parameters .|The V ( max ) values of both mutant recombinant enzymes were markedly reduced ( less than 0 . 9 % of the control ) , and the K ( m ) values were unchanged compared with the corresponding wild - type enzyme isolated at the same time .|Both the Arg ( 148 ) Ser beta - galactosidase in CHO cells and Asp ( 332 ) Asn beta - galactosidases ( in COS - 1 and CHO cells ) produced abundant immunoreaction in the perinuclear area , consistent with localization in the ER .|A low amount was detected in lysosomes .|Incubation of patient fibroblasts in the presence of leupeptin , which reduces the rate of degradation of lysosomal beta - galactosidase by thiol proteases , had no effect on residual enzyme activity , and immunostaining was again detected largely in the perinuclear area ( localized to the ER ) with much lower amounts in the lysosomes .|In summary , the Arg ( 148 ) Ser mutation has no effect on catalytic activity , whereas the Asp ( 332 ) Asn mutation seriously reduces catalytic activity , suggesting that Asp ( 332 ) might play a role in the active site .|Immunofluorescence studies indicate the expressed mutant proteins with Arg ( 148 ) Ser and Asp ( 332 ) Asn mutations are held up in the ER , where they are probably degraded , resulting in only minimum amounts of the enzyme becoming localized in the lysosomes .|These results are completely consistent with findings in the cultured fibroblasts .|Our results imply that most of the missense mutations described in G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis to date have little effect on catalytic activity , but do affect protein conformation such that the resulting protein can not be transported out of the ER and fails to arrive in the lysosome .|This accounts for the minimal amounts of enzyme protein and activity seen in most G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	532-533	528-531	2720	beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase	Gene	297:2:160:170:237:259:528:593	300:5:163:173:240:262:531:596	5:0:2:2:4:4:10:12	D010051	Chinese hamster ovary|CHO|CHO|CHO|CHO	Disease	278:282:436:532:549	281:283:437:533:550	5:5:8:10:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	32-34	2-5	2720	beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase|beta - galactosidase	Gene	297:2:160:170:237:259:528:593	300:5:163:173:240:262:531:596	5:0:2:2:4:4:10:12	D016537	GM1 gangliosidosis|G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis|G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis|G ( M1 ) gangliosidosis	Disease	32:49:747:801	34:54:752:806	0:1:16:17

10873095	Cyclooxygenase - 2 expression is up - regulated in transitional cell carcinoma and its preneoplastic lesions in the human urinary bladder .|Cyclooxygenase ( COX ) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid .|Much evidence , including that from epidemiological and experimental studies , suggests that the inducible form of COX , COX - 2 , is increased in colon tumor tissues and is involved in colon cancer tumorigenesis .|To determine the significance of COX - 2 in tumorigenesis in the urinary bladder , the expression of COX - 2 in transitional cell carcinoma and preneoplastic lesions of the bladder was examined .|Tumor specificity of COX - 2 immunoblotting was 100 % in 12 of 35 ( 34 % ) tumors , but in 0 of the 10 normal urothelia samples .|COX - 2 expression was significantly correlated with tumor stage in 9 of 20 ( 45 % ) muscle - invasive ( pT2 - 4 ) tumors and in 3 of 15 ( 20 % ) superficially invasive ( pT1 ) tumors ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|Immunohistochemical examination revealed that 13 of 14 ( 93 % ) samples of carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) , which may be the precursor of muscle - invasive - type tumors , expressed COX - 2 , whereas 10 of 21 ( 48 % ) samples of dysplasia , which may be the precursor of both superficially invasive and muscle - invasive tumors , expressed COX - 2 .|From the expression profile of COX - 2 in these various urothelia , it is suggested that COX - 2 is involved in the development of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder , especially that of muscle - invasive tumors via CIS .|Furthermore , COX - 2 may be a therapeutic target for CIS because of the high expression rate of COX - 2 in CIS lesions .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	238-239	224-227	4513	COX - 2|COX - 2|COX - 2|COX - 2|COX - 2|COX - 2|COX - 2|COX -

10982033	Two common endoglin mutations in families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in the Netherlands Antilles : evidence for a founder effect .|Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder characterized by localized angiodysplasia .|Mutations in either of two genes , endoglin or ALK - 1 , can cause HHT .|Both genes encode putative receptors for the transforming growth factor - beta superfamily of ligands .|Many mutations in each gene have been identified in HHT kindreds from around the world , and with few exceptions mutations are unique and family specific .|The prevalence of HHT in the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles is possibly the highest of any geographical location .|We wished to establish whether this high prevalence is due to a genetic founder effect or to multiple mutational events .|HHT kindreds from the Netherlands Antilles and The Netherlands were screened for mutations in the two genes associated with HHT .|Haplotype analysis of a 5 - cM region on chromosome 9 flanking the endoglin gene revealed three distinct disease haplotypes in the ten Antillean families studied .|Seven of these families share a splice - site mutation in exon 1 of endoglin .|Two other Antillean families share a missense mutation in exon 9a of endoglin .|This mutation was also found in a Dutch family that shares the same disease haplotype as the Antillean families with this mutation .|Thus it appears that HHT in the Netherlands Antilles is due to a limited number of ancestral mutations in the endoglin gene , and that one of these mutations was introduced into the African slave population by a Dutch colonist .|The limited scope of mutations suggests that a presymptomatic screening program for HHT would be feasible in this population .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	7-10	2-3	2022	endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin	Gene	2:45:174:202:216:261	3:46:175:203:217:262	0:2:8:9:10:12	D013683	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT	Disease	7:21:25:53:80:101:140:159:245:294	10:24:26:54:81:102:141:160:246:295	0:1:1:2:4:5:7:7:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	53-54	47-50	6590	ALK - 1	Gene	47	50	2	D013683	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT|HHT	Disease	7:21:25:53:80:101:140:159:245:294	10:24:26:54:81:102:141:160:246:295	0:1:1:2:4:5:7:7:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	45-46	36-37	2022	endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin	Gene	2:45:174:202:216:261	3:46:175:203:217:262	0:2:8:9:10:12	D016888	angiodysplasia	Disease	36	37	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	47-50	36-37	6590	ALK - 1	Gene	47	50	2	D016888	angiodysplasia	Disease	36	37	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	45-46	29-33	2022	endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin|endoglin	Gene	2:45:174:202:216:261	3:46:175:203:217:262	0:2:8:9:10:12	D030342	autosomal dominant bleeding disorder	Disease	29	33	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	47-50	29-33	6590	ALK - 1	Gene	47	50	2	D030342	autosomal dominant bleeding disorder	Disease	29	33	1
