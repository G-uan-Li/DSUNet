10213916	Urocortin and inflammation : confounding effects of hypotension on measures of inflammation .|Urocortin , a newly isolated 40 - amino - acid mammalian peptide homologous to corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH ) , activates both CRH type 1 and 2 receptors , but may be an endogenous ligand for CRH receptor type 2 .|Urocortin given systemically inhibited heat - induced paw edema in the rat , and was therefore ascribed anti - inflammatory properties .|We examined the effects of urocortin in the carrageenin - induced subcutaneous inflammation model .|Rats were treated with urocortin 200 ( n = 6 ) or 20 nmol / kg ( n = 6 ) ; inflammatory exudates were reduced by approximately 30 % compared to controls ( n = 7 ) at both doses .|However , since subcutaneous urocortin has been shown to reduce arterial blood pressure , we tested the hypothesis that its antiedema and antiextravasatory effects were secondary to arterial hypotension .|Therefore , we examined the parallel effects of urocortin - and hydralazine - induced hypotension on acute inflammation induced by carrageenin in the rat .|Rats were treated with subcutaneous carrageenin and control injections ( n = 8 ) , carrageenin and urocortin ( 20 nmol / kg , n = 9 ) , or carrageenin and intraperitoneal hydralazine ( 10 mg / kg , n = 8 ) .|Mean arterial blood pressure was measured hourly for 7 h in 12 animals , and after 2 h , the nadir of treatment , in a further 13 animals .|Rats were then sacrificed , and the inflammatory exudate volume and leukocyte count were measured .|Mean exudate volumes were reduced from 4 . 8 + / - 0 . 5 ml ( controls ) to 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 ml ( p = 0 . 004 ) and 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 6 ml ( p = 0 . 007 ) in urocortin - and hydralazine - treated animals , respectively .|Urocortin and hydralazine both produced a significant fall in blood pressure compared to controls , with mean arterial pressure 2 h after carrageenin injection falling to 51 . 0 + / - 4 . 1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and 34 . 6 + / - 4 . 6 ( p < 0 . 001 ) vs .|92 . 9 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg in controls , respectively .|A significant positive correlation was noted between blood pressure and inflammatory exudate volume ( r = 0 .|52 , p = 0 . 007 ) .|As both hydralazine and urocortin lowered blood pressure and inflammatory exudate volume , we suggest that the anti - inflammatory effects of urocortin and related neuropeptides may be nonspecific , acting through hypotension rather than through direct anti - inflammatory mechanisms .|The use of inflammatory models which rely on extravasation may be inappropriate for the study of substances that produce hypotension .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	64-65	51-52	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D004487	edema	Disease	64	65	2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	64-65	56-57	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D004487	edema	Disease	64	65	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	27-31	7-8	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D007022	hypotension|hypotension|hypotension|fall in blood pressure|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	7:163:179:354:483:512	8:164:180:358:484:513	0:5:6:11:15:16	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	13-14	7-8	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D007022	hypotension|hypotension|hypotension|fall in blood pressure|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	7:163:179:354:483:512	8:164:180:358:484:513	0:5:6:11:15:16	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	27-31	11-12	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D007249	inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation	Disease	2:11:90:182	3:12:91:183	0:0:3:6	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	2-3	0-1	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D007249	inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation	Disease	2:11:90:182	3:12:91:183	0:0:3:6

10533957	Lipolysis is an important determinant of isoproterenol - induced myocardial necrosis .|The cardiotoxic effect of isoproterenol ( ISO ) is associated with , and possibly due to , calcium overload .|Prior work suggests that calcium entry into cardiac myocytes after ISO administration occurs in two phases : an early rapid phase , followed by a slow phase beginning about 1 hour after ISO injection , leading to a peak myocardial calcium level after about 4 hours .|We have tested the relationship of these phases to myocardial necrosis ( MN ) by determining the time after ISO administration at which the commitment to MN occurs .|This was done by administration of propranolol at various times before and after ISO .|In addition , since ISO induces lipolysis , and lipids can be toxic , experiments were conducted to determine if adrenergically - activated lipolysis could play a significant role in ISO - MN .|We found that propranolol protected the myocardium equally well when administered anytime within 2 hours of ISO injection , but had no effect when given 4 hours after ISO .|This showed that metabolic events taking place more than two hours after ISO injection are required for ISO - MN .|As expected from prior work , there was a small and consistent amount of propranolol - resistant ISO - MN .|Lipolysis , assessed by measuring serum glycerol levels , increased to tenfold above base line at one hour after ISO administration and returned to near basal levels at 4 hours .|Potentiation of lipolysis by intravenous injections of phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) or lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) to rats treated with ISO substantially augmented MN .|Propranolol completely blocked the increase in necrosis produced by PLA2 when given with ISO .|Lipases induced only minimal necrosis in the absence of ISO .|Administration of adenosine ( an anti - lipolytic agent ) , oxfenicine ( an inhibitor of mitochondrial palmitoyl carnitine transferase ) , or vitamin C ( an anti - oxidant ) resulted in a 55 - 60 % reduction in MN .|These results suggest that critical necrosis - determining events occur between 2 and 4 hours after ISO administration and imply a relationship between ISO - induced lipolysis , calcium influx , and ISO - MN .|We hypothesize that importance of lipolysis as a determinant of ISO - MN is related to the generation of free fatty acids , their oxidized / metabolic products , or direct damage to plasma membrane .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	285-286	276-277	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D009202	myocardial necrosis|myocardial necrosis|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN	Disease	9:88:91:105:155:206:227:285:353:389:403	11:90:92:106:156:207:228:286:354:390:404	0:3:3:3:5:7:8:10:13:14:15	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	293-294	276-277	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D009336	necrosis|necrosis|necrosis	Disease	293:306:360	294:307:361	11:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	273-275	13-14	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D066126	cardiotoxic	Disease	13	14	1

10702401	Association of EWS - FLI1 type 1 fusion with lower proliferative rate in Ewing 's sarcoma .|The Ewing 's sarcoma ( ES ) family of tumors , including peripheral neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , is defined genetically by specific chromosomal translocations resulting in fusion of the EWS gene with a member of the ETS family of transcription factors , either FLI1 ( 90 - 95 % ) or ERG ( 5 - 10 % ) .|A second level of molecular genetic heterogeneity stems from the variation in the location of the translocation breakpoints , resulting in the inclusion of different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 ( or ERG ) in the fusion products .|The most common type of EWS - FLI1 fusion transcript , type 1 , is associated with a favorable prognosis and appears to encode a functionally weaker transactivator , compared to other fusion types .|We sought to determine whether the observed covariation of structure , function , and clinical course correlates with tumor cell kinetic parameters such as proliferative rate and apoptosis , and with expression of the receptor for insulin - like growth factor I ( IGF - 1R ) .|In a group of 86 ES / PNET with defined EWS - ETS fusions ( 45 EWS - FLI1 type 1 , 27 EWS - FLI1 non - type 1 , 14 EWS - ERG ) , we assessed proliferation rate by immunostaining for Ki - 67 using MIB1 antibody ( n = 85 ) , apoptosis by TUNEL assay ( n = 66 ) , and IGF - 1R expression by immunostaining with antibody 1H7 ( n = 78 ) .|Ki - 67 proliferative index was lower in tumors with EWS - FLI1 type 1 than those with non - type 1 EWS - FLI1 , whether analyzed as a continuous ( P = 0 . 049 ) or categorical ( P = 0 . 047 ) variable .|Logistic regression analysis suggests that this association was secondary to the association of type 1 EWS - FLI1 and lower IGF - 1R expression ( P = 0 . 04 ) .|Comparing EWS - FLI1 to EWS - ERG cases , Ki - 67 proliferative index was higher in the latter ( P = 0 . 01 , Mann - Whitney test ;

12631109	Preemptive ramipril therapy delays renal failure and reduces renal fibrosis in COL4A3 - knockout mice with Alport syndrome .|BACKGROUND : Alport syndrome ( AS ) is a common hereditary cause of end - stage renal failure in adolescence due to defects in type IV collagen genes .|Molecular genetics allows early diagnosis , however , no preventive strategy can be offered .|Using the COL4A3 - / - mouse , an animal model for human AS , we evaluated therapy with ramipril in mice .|METHODS : One hundred and twenty - two Alport - mice were treated with 10 mg / kg / day ramipril added to drinking water .|Proteinuria , serum - urea and lifespan were monitored .|Renal matrix was characterized by immunohistochemistry , light - and electron microscopy , and Western blot .|RESULTS : Untreated COL4A3 - / - mice died from renal failure after 71 + / - 6 days .|Early therapy starting at four weeks of age and continuing to death delayed onset and reduced the extent of proteinuria .|Uremia was postponed by three weeks in treated animals .|Lifespan increased by more than 100 % to 150 + / - 21 days ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|In parallel , decreased deposition of extracellular matrix and lessened interstitial fibrosis as well as reduced amounts of renal transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) could be demonstrated .|Late therapy starting at seven weeks decreased proteinuria , however , lifespan did not increase significantly .|CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate an antiproteinuric and antifibrotic nephroprotective effect of ramipril in COL4A3 - / - mice is mediated by down - regulation of TGF - beta1 .|This effect in mice is enhanced by initiation of therapy during pre - symptomatic disease .|The data in COL4A3 - / - mice as an animal - model for Alport syndrome suggest that ramipril might as well delay renal failure in humans with AS .|Early diagnosis and preemptive treatment also may be crucial in humans .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	276-277	222-224	1285	COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3	Gene	11:65:142:276:311	12:66:143:277:312	0:3:7:13:15	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	222	224	11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	231-236	222-224	7040	transforming growth factor -

alpha ( + 252A / G ) genotypes showed statistically significant differences between patients and the reference group .|The proportion of individuals carrying the LT - alpha 1 / 1 genotype was significantly lower in the group of patients with chronic periodontitis ( 0 . 8 % ) than in the control group ( 8 . 8 % ) ( P < 0 . 0094 , Pcorr < 0 . 05 ) .|However , the significant differences in the frequencies of the combined genotypes ( TNF - alpha and LT - alpha ) between the control and the patient groups were found using a simulation by applying the Monte - Carlo method ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that combined genotypes composed of the TNF - alpha and LT - alpha gene polymorphisms may influence the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis .|We also showed that , comparing the two genes , the 1 / 1 genotype of the NcoI polymorphism in the first intron of the LT - alpha gene is a more informative marker and it may be one of the protective genetic factors against chronic periodontitis in our population .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	52-54	10-13	4049	lymphotoxin - alpha|lymphotoxin alpha|LT -

14521605	Identification of a novel point mutation in platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha , Gly to Ser at residue 233 , in a Japanese family with platelet - type von Willebrand disease .|BACKGROUND : Interaction between platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ibalpha and von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) has critical roles in both physiological hemostasis and thrombosis .|Platelet - type von Willebrand disease ( plt - VWD ) is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by gain - of - function mutations of GPIbalpha .|To date , two mutations in GPIbalpha , G233V and M239V , have been reported in four unrelated families with plt - VWD .|OBJECTIVE : The present study aimed to determine whether G233S of GPIbalpha , a new mutation observed in plt - VWD patients , causes the plt - VWD phenotype and to examine whether conversions to other residues at this position affect VWF binding .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : The propositus was a 3 - year - old Japanese male .|He displayed bleeding symptoms and moderate thrombocytopenia .|His brother was similarly affected .|Platelets from both patients were analyzed by ristocetin - or shear - induced platelet aggregation .|DNA sequencing was performed to analyze the GPIbalpha sequence .|We examined the 125I -

C , and activated matrix metalloproteinase - 9 , factors already implicated in human PAH .|Finally , assessment of steady state mRNA showed that whereas expression of ET ( B ) receptors was decreased in MCT ( sl / sl ) rat lungs , ET ( A ) receptor expression increased .|CONCLUSIONS : Deficiency of the ET ( B ) receptor markedly accelerates the progression of PAH in rats treated with MCT and enhances the appearance of cellular and molecular markers associated with the pathobiology of PAH .|Collectively , these results suggest an overall antiproliferative effect of the ET ( B ) receptor in pulmonary vascular homeostasis .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	10-13	2-5	1910	endothelin B receptor	Gene	10	13	0	D001157	occlusive neointimal lesions|occlusive neointimal lesions	Disease	2:55	5:58	0:1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	334-337	55-58	3371	tenascin -

16255050	Evidence for common genetic control in pathways of inflammation for Crohn 's disease and psoriatic arthritis .|OBJECTIVE : Clinical , pharmacologic , and epidemiologic evidence supports the hypothesis that common genetic pathways may underlie inflammatory diseases .|In a previous study , a Crohn 's disease gene , CARD15 , was demonstrated to be associated with psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) .|Recently , a functional haplotype of 2 single -

2 . 41 , uncorrected P = 0 . 005 ) .|In addition , the haplotype associated with Crohn 's disease was also associated with PsA ( P = 0 . 001 ) .|No association was detected in the cohort with psoriasis alone or in the cohort with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis .|CONCLUSION : The OCTN haplotype previously associated with Crohn 's disease is also associated with PsA , suggesting that these 2 diseases may share some common genetic control in pathways of inflammation .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	229-230	202-204	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	202-204	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	202-204	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-136	111-113	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	111-113	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	111-113	90-91	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	49-50	44-47	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	104-105	97-100	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	97-100	90-91	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	49-50	35-37	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	35-37	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	90-91	35-37	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	229-230	191-192	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	191-192	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	229-230	227-228	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	123-124	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	252-253	245-246	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13

10A / G gene had no significant differences between the healthy group and the control group ( P > 0 . 05 ) .|Levels of CRP , TNF - alpha , CH50 and C3 of ESRD patients with IL - 10A / A genotype were significantly higher than those of ESRD patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 05 ) , while IL - 10 and Alb were significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The production of IL - 10 in serum from patients with IL - 10A / A genotype was significantly lower than that of patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The incidence rate of AS of patients with IL - 10 - 1082A / A genotype was significantly higher than that of patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The raise of AS incidence rate was correspondent with the decline of serum IL - 10 and raise of serum CRP and Fib .|CONCLUSION : The IL - 10A / A genotype is a predictable factor of microinflammatory state and high AS incidence rate in ESRD patients .|We use IL - 10G / G genotype to modulate the high production of serum IL - 10 , to decline inflammatory reaction and to keep away from microinflammation and AS in ESRD patients .|We should work hard on improving the dialysis membrane to reduce the anti - inflammatory factors in uremia for chronic renal failure patients with high arteriosclerosis risk .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	150-151	140-141	1401	CRP|CRP|CRP	Gene	150:237:399	151:238:400	3:5:8	D001161	arteriosclerosis|microinflammatory state and arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis	Disease	32:73:78:112:140:343:382:421:458:488	33:77:79:113:141:344:383:422:459:489	0:1:1:2:2:7:8:9:10:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	164-165	140-141	213	Alb|Alb|Alb	Gene	164:190:286	165:191:287	3:3:5	D001161	arteriosclerosis|microinflammatory state and arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis	Disease	32:73:78:112:140:343:382:421:458:488	33:77:79:113:141:344:383:422:459:489	0:1:1:2:2:7:8:9:10:11	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	347-350	343-344	3586	interleukin -

16507146	Cytokine polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes in SLE patients treated with antimalarial drugs .|Antimalarial agents have been widely used as disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and other rheumatological diseases , although their mechanism of action has not yet been fully defined .|It is known , however , that effective response to treatment is variable among patients .|Thus , the identification of genetic predictors of treatment response would provide valuable information for therapeutic intervention .|The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of antimalarial treatment on tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha serum levels and evaluate the possible influence of TNFalpha and IL - 10 functional genetic polymorphisms on the response to antimalarial drugs .|To this end , TNFalpha serum levels were quantified in 171 SLE patients and 215 healthy controls by ELISA techniques and polymorphisms at positions - 1 , 082 and - 308 of the IL - 10 and TNFalpha gene promoters were determined by PCR amplification followed by hybridization with fluorescent - labeled allele - specific probes in 192 SLE patients and 343 matched controls .|Data were related to clinical features and treatment at the time of sampling and during the course of the disease .|Results showed a significantly higher amount of serum TNFalpha in the entire SLE population compared with controls .|However , TNFalpha serum levels correlated negatively with the use of antimalarial treatment during at least three months before sampling .|Patients under single or combined treatment with these drugs had TNFalpha serum levels similar to healthy controls , whereas untreated patients and those under corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies had increased amounts of this cytokine .|This suggests , however , that antimalarial - mediated inhibition of TNFalpha was only significant in patients who were genetically high TNFalpha or low IL - 10 producers .|In addition , evaluation of SLE patients administered antimalarial drugs for three or more years who did not require any other specific SLE treatment indicates that patients with the combined genotype low IL - 10 / high TNFalpha are the best responders to antimalarial therapy , developing mild disease with a good course under this treatment .|In conclusion , we proposed that an antimalarial - mediated downregulation of TNFalpha levels in SLE patients is influenced by polymorphisms at IL - 10 and TNFalpha promoters .|Our results may thus find important clinical application through the identification of patients who are the most likely to benefit from antimalarial therapy .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	118-121	37-39	3586	IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10	Gene	118:164:315:352:399	121:167:318:355:402	4:5:10:11:12	D004194	rheumatological diseases	Disease	37	39	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	101-104	37-39	7124	tumor necrosis factor|TNF ) alpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha	Gene	101:105:116:135:168:225:237:266:302:312:357:389:403	104:108:117:136:169:226:238:267:303:313:358:390:404	4:4:4:5:5:7:8:9:10:10:11:12:12	D004194	rheumatological diseases	Disease	37	39	1	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	399-402	392-393	3586	IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10	Gene	118:164:315:352:399	121:167:318:355:402	4:5:10:11:12	D008180	SLE|systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE	Disease	6:29:33:142:189:229:325:342:392	7:32:34:143:190:230:326:343:393	0:1:1:5:5:7:11:11:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	392-393	389-390	7124	tumor necrosis factor|TNF ) alpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha	Gene	101:105:116:135:168:225:237:266:302:312:357:389:403	104:108:117:136:169:226:238:267:303:313:358:390:404	4:4:4:5:5:7:8:9:10:10:11:12:12	D008180	SLE|systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE	Disease	6:29:33:142:189:229:325:342:392	7:32:34:143:190:230:326:343:393	0:1:1:5:5:7:11:11:12

16824064	Interleukin - 8 gene polymorphism associated with susceptibility to non - cardia gastric carcinoma with microsatellite instability .|BACKGROUND AND AIM : Gastric carcinoma ( GC ) with microsatellite instability ( MSI ) exhibits clinicopathological characteristics distinct from microsatellite - stable ( MSS ) GC .|Both MSI and MSS carcinomas are mostly associated with chronic gastritis infected by Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) .|The relationship between Hp - induced inflammation and the mutator pathway of MSI remains unclear .|Recently , cytokine polymorphisms have been reported to affect the development of non - cardia GC .|The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between cytokine polymorphisms and MSI phenotypes .|METHODS : In a case - control study including 482 controls and 181 patients with GC , interleukin ( IL ) - 8 - 251 , IL - 1B - 511 , IL - 1RN , and tumor necrosis factor - A ( TNFA ) - 857 polymorphisms were genotyped .|The presence of MSI and mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were examined in GC cases .|All clinicopathological data were collected from individual records .|RESULTS : High and low frequency of MSI ( MSI - H and MSI - L ) and MSS were detected in 16 ( 8 . 8 % ) , 14 ( 7 . 7 % ) and 151 ( 83 . 4 % ) GC cases , respectively .|We found that IL - 8 - 251 T / T genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of MSI - H GC compared to MSI - L / MSS GC and controls .|We found no association between other cytokine polymorphisms and MSI - H GC .|The percentage of smokers and the frequency of p53 mutations were significantly lower in MSI - H than MSI - L / MSS GC .|We found significant associations of MSI - H with synchronous or metachronous multiple occurrence , antral location and intestinal type .|CONCLUSIONS : Our study shows that MSI - H GC is associated with IL - 8 - 251 T / T ( low expression genotype ) and is inversely correlated with cigarette smoking .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	31-32	5928	MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI - L	Gene	31:77:112:169:203:209	32:78:113:170:204:212	1:3:5:7:9:9	C536652	MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI -

) .|3 .|The assessment of haemostasis parameters levels and ACE activity in effect of treatment with perindopril in relation to ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : The study involved 78 male divided on two groups : cases and controls .|The cases contained 44 male outpatients ( 25 - 38 years old ) with untreated essential hypertension without clinical feature of coronary heart disease and 34 age - and gender - matched healthy controls .|CONCLUSION : 1 .|Untreated essential hypertension predisposes to the procoagulant state characterised by increased Fb level and suppressed of fibrinolysis .|These changes not depend on ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|The left ventricular hypertrophy not intensificates the procoagulant state .|2 .|The treatment with perindopril decreases blood pressure effectively independent of ACE gene I / D genotype and left ventricular hypertrophy .|Perindopril impairs RAS activity , most in patients with ACE gene II genotype .|The treatment with perindopril is only partially effective in alleviating the procoagulant state , by reducing fibrinogen level in II homozygotes due to its more potent inhibitory action on the RAS in this group .|The treatment makes fibrinolysis better mainly to high t - PA levels , independently of ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|3 .|Left ventricular hypertrophy not differentiates the response on treatment in relation to haemostasis parameters and RAS , however there was a slight decrease in ACE activity in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy .|4 .|The changes in haemostasis system and ACE activity , observed during treatment , suggest the appearance of positive relation between haemostasis and RAS .|Probably the antithrombotic act of perindopril is more pronounced in II genotype group .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	236-237	195-198	1636	ACE|angiotensin converting enzyme I|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	5:72:77:138:149:236:265:285:340:373:390	6:76:78:139:150:237:266:286:341:374:391	0:2:2:6:6:11:14:15:17:19:21	D003327	coronary heart disease	Disease	195	198	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	306-307	195-198	2244	fibrinogen|fibrinogen	Gene	28:306	29:307	2:16	D003327	coronary heart disease	Disease	195	198	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	333-336	195-198	5327	tissue plasminogen activator ( t -

17151092	Chemopreventive anti - inflammatory activities of curcumin and other phytochemicals mediated by MAP kinase phosphatase - 5 in prostate cells .|As inflammation emerges as a risk factor for prostate cancer ( PCa ) , there is potential for chemoprevention by anti - inflammatory agents .|Dietary phytochemicals have been shown to have chemopreventive properties which may include anti - inflammatory activities .|In this study , we demonstrate a role for mitogen - activated protein kinase phosphatase - 5 ( MKP5 ) in mediating anti - inflammatory activities of the phytochemicals curcumin , resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol .|We utilized the cytokines tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFalpha ) and interleukin ( IL ) - 1beta to increase p38 - dependent nuclear factor kappa - B ( NFkappaB ) activation and expression of pro - inflammatory genes cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , IL - 6 and IL - 8 in normal prostatic epithelial cells .|MKP5 over - expression decreased cytokine - induced NFkappaB activation , COX - 2 , IL - 6 and IL - 8 in normal prostatic epithelial cells , suggesting potent anti - inflammatory activity of MKP5 .|Pretreatment of cells with a p38 inhibitor mimicked the results observed with MKP5 over - expression , further implicating p38 inhibition as the main activity of MKP5 .|Curcumin , the phytochemical found in turmeric , up - regulated MKP5 , subsequently decreasing cytokine - induced p38 - dependent pro - inflammatory changes in normal prostatic epithelial cells .|Resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol , phytochemicals present in red wine and ginger , respectively , also up - regulated MKP5 in normal prostate epithelial cells .|Moreover , we found that PCa cell lines DU 145 , PC - 3 , LNCaP and LAPC - 4 retained the ability to up - regulate MKP5 following curcumin , resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol exposure , suggesting utility of these phytochemicals in PCa treatment .|In summary , our findings show direct anti - inflammatory activity of MKP5 in prostate cells and suggest that up - regulation of MKP5 by phytochemicals may contribute to their chemopreventive actions by decreasing prostatic inflammation .	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	22-23	12-17	11221	MAP kinase phosphatase -

based population .|Haplotypes were estimated for each gene using the EM algorithm , and empirical p values were obtained for a logistic regression - based score test , adjusted for significant covariates .|An interaction model between maternal and offspring genotypes was also evaluated .|The most significant findings for association with PE were COL1A1 ( p = 0 . 0011 ) and IL1A ( p = 0 . 0014 ) for the maternal genotype , and PLAUR ( p = 0 . 0008 ) for the offspring genotype .|Common candidate genes for PE , including MTHFR and NOS3 , were not significantly associated with PE .|For the interaction model , SNPs within IGF1 ( p = 0 . 0035 ) and IL4R ( p = 0 . 0036 ) gave the most significant results .|This study is one of the most comprehensive genetic association studies of PE to date , including an evaluation of offspring genotypes that have rarely been considered in previous studies .|Although we did not identify statistically significant evidence of association for any of the candidate loci evaluated here after adjusting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate , additional compelling evidence exists , including multiple SNPs with nominally significant p values in COL1A1 and the IL1A region , and previous reports of association for IL1A , to support continued interest in these genes as candidates for PE .|Identification of the genetic regulators of PE may have broader implications , since women with PE are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases later in life .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	367-368	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	270-271	3479	IGF1	Gene	270	271	9	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	379-380	3552	IL1A|IL1A|IL1A	Gene	218:370:379	219:371:380	7:11:11	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	279-280	3566	IL4R	Gene	279	280	9	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	252-253	4524	MTHFR	Gene	252	253	8	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	254-255	4846	NOS3	Gene	254	255	8	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	232-233	5329	PLAUR	Gene	232	233	7	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	367-368	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	270-271	3479	IGF1	Gene	270	271	9	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	379-380	3552	IL1A|IL1A|IL1A	Gene	218:370:379	219:371:380	7:11:11	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	279-280	3566	IL4R	Gene	279	280	9	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	252-253	4524	MTHFR	Gene	252	253	8	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	254-255	4846	NOS3	Gene	254	255	8	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	232-233	5329	PLAUR	Gene	232	233	7	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	209-210	207-208	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D011225	pre -

17186461	Mutations of presenilin genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure .|Two common disorders of the elderly are heart failure and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .|Heart failure usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) .|DCM of unknown cause in families has recently been shown to result from genetic disease , highlighting newly discovered disease mechanisms .|AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease of older Americans .|Familial AD is caused most commonly by presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ) or presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) mutations , a discovery that has greatly advanced the field .|The presenilins are also expressed in the heart and are critical to cardiac development .|We hypothesized that mutations in presenilins may also be associated with DCM and that their discovery could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of DCM and heart failure .|A total of 315 index patients with DCM were evaluated for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2 .|Families positive for mutations underwent additional clinical , genetic , and functional studies .|A novel PSEN1 missense mutation ( Asp333Gly ) was identified in one family , and a single PSEN2 missense mutation ( Ser130Leu ) was found in two other families .|Both mutations segregated with DCM and heart failure .|The PSEN1 mutation was associated with complete penetrance and progressive disease that resulted in the necessity of cardiac transplantation or in death .|The PSEN2 mutation showed partial penetrance , milder disease , and a more favorable prognosis .|Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers .|These data indicate that PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are associated with DCM and heart failure and implicate novel mechanisms of myocardial disease

17203304	Evidence for epistasis between SLC6A4 and ITGB3 in autism etiology and in the determination of platelet serotonin levels .|Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unclear etiology .|The consistent finding of platelet hyperserotonemia in a proportion of patients and its heritability within affected families suggest that genes involved in the serotonin system play a role in this disorder .|The role in autism etiology of seven candidate genes in the serotonin metabolic and neurotransmission pathways and mapping to autism linkage regions ( SLC6A4 , HTR1A , HTR1D , HTR2A , HTR5A , TPH1 and ITGB3 ) was analyzed in a sample of 186 nuclear families .|The impact of interactions among these genes in autism was assessed using the multifactor - dimensionality reduction ( MDR ) method in 186 patients and 181 controls .|We further evaluated whether the effect of specific gene variants or gene interactions associated with autism etiology might be mediated by their influence on serotonin levels , using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test ( QTDT ) and the restricted partition method ( RPM ) , in a sample of 109 autistic children .|We report a significant main effect of the HTR5A gene in autism ( P = 0 . 0088 ) , and a significant three - locus model comprising a synergistic interaction between the ITGB3 and SLC6A4 genes with an additive effect of HTR5A ( P < 0 . 0010 ) .|In addition to the previously reported contribution of SLC6A4 , we found significant associations of ITGB3 haplotypes with serotonin level distribution ( P = 0 . 0163 ) .|The most significant models contributing to serotonin distribution were found for interactions between TPH1 rs4537731 and SLC6A4 haplotypes ( P = 0 . 002 ) and between HTR1D rs6300 and SLC6A4 haplotypes ( P = 0 . 013 ) .|In addition to the significant independent effects , evidence for interaction between SLC6A4 and ITGB3 markers was also found .|The overall results implicate SLC6A4 and ITGB3 gene interactions in autism etiology and in serotonin level determination , providing evidence for a common underlying genetic mechanism and a molecular explanation for the association of platelet hyperserotonemia with autism
