10050867	Association between nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation and BRCA1 mutation in germline DNA of patients with ovarian cancer .|BACKGROUND : Most human female cells contain two X chromosomes , only one of which is active .|The process of X - chromosome inactivation , which occurs early in development , is usually random , producing tissues with equal mixtures of cells having active X chromosomes of either maternal or paternal origin .|However , nonrandom inactivation may occur in a subset of females .|If a tumor suppressor gene were located on the X chromosome and if females with a germline mutation in one copy of that suppressor gene experienced nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation , then some or all of the tissues of such women might lack the wild - type suppressor gene function .|This scenario could represent a previously unrecognized mechanism for development of hereditary cancers .|We investigated whether such a mechanism might contribute to the development of hereditary ovarian cancers .|METHODS : Patterns of X - chromosome inactivation were determined by means of polymerase chain reaction amplification of the CAG - nucleotide repeat of the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene after methylation - sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion of blood mononuclear cell DNA from patients with invasive ( n = 213 ) or borderline ( n = 44 ) ovarian cancer and control subjects without a personal or family history of cancer ( n = 50 ) .|BRCA1 gene status was determined by means of single - strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing .|All statistical tests were two - sided .|RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Among individuals informative for the AR locus , nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation was found in the DNA of 53 % of those with invasive cancer versus 28 % of those with borderline cancer ( P = . 005 ) and 33 % of healthy control subjects ( P = . 016 ) .|Nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation can be a heritable trait .|Nine of 11 AR - informative carriers of germline BRCA1 mutations demonstrated nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation ( . 0002 < P < . 008 , for simultaneous occurrence of both ) .|IMPLICATIONS : Nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation may be a predisposing factor for the development of invasive , but not borderline , ovarian cancer .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	299-301	280-281	367	androgen receptor|AR|AR|AR	Gene	192:195:280:343	194:196:281:344	7:7:10:12	D009362	invasive cancer	Disease	299	301	10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	349-350	299-301	672	BRCA1|BRCA1|BRCA1	Gene	8:245:349	9:246:350	0:8:12	D009362	invasive cancer	Disease	299	301	10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	308-309	280-281	367	androgen receptor|AR|AR|AR	Gene	192:195:280:343	194:196:281:344	7:7:10:12	D009369	tumor|cancer|cancer	Disease	87:238:308	88:239:309	4:7:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	238-239	672	BRCA1|BRCA1|BRCA1	Gene	8:245:349	9:246:350	0:8:12	D009369	tumor|cancer|cancer	Disease	87:238:308	88:239:309	4:7:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	192-194	148-150	367	androgen receptor|AR|AR|AR	Gene	192:195:280:343	194:196:281:344	7:7:10:12	D009386	hereditary cancers	Disease	148	150	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	148-150	672	BRCA1|BRCA1|BRCA1	Gene	8:245:349	9:246:350	0:8:12	D009386	hereditary cancers	Disease	148	150	5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	192-194	163-166	367	androgen receptor|AR|AR|AR	Gene	192:195:280:343	194:196:281:344	7:7:10:12	D010051	ovarian cancer|hereditary ovarian cancers|ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer	Disease	16:163:226:395	18:166:228:397	0:6:7:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-18	8-9	672	BRCA1|BRCA1|BRCA1	Gene	8:245:349	9:246:350	0:8:12	D010051	ovarian cancer|hereditary ovarian cancers|ovarian cancer|ovarian cancer	Disease	16:163:226:395	18:166:228:397	0:6:7:13

however , iNOS protein was only detected when the cytokine interleukin - 1beta was present .|To study whether iNOS activity contributed to myocardial damage ( eg , infarct size ) , we administered the first dose of the NOS inhibitors 24 h before LAD occlusion and then a second dose after surgery .|Inhibition of iNOS activity with aminoguanidine reduced infarct size by 20 % but had no effect on infiltration by neutrophils , whereas the more selective inhibitor S - methylisothiourea sulfate reduced infarct size by 41 % .|These data suggest that NO derived from the iNOS isoform contributes to some of the myocardial injury following MI , possibly by causing myocardial cell death in areas bordering the ischemic region of the heart .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	257-260	245-246	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D000860	hypoxia|hypoxia|hypoxia	Disease	117:221:245	118:222:246	3:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	224-225	221-222	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D000860	hypoxia|hypoxia|hypoxia	Disease	117:221:245	118:222:246	3:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	275-276	257-260	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D007238	infarct|infarct|infarct|infarct	Disease	154:275:308:332	155:276:309:333	3:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	308-309	303-304	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D007238	infarct|infarct|infarct|infarct	Disease	154:275:308:332	155:276:309:333	3:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	368-369	257-260	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D007511	ischemic|ischemic	Disease	75:368	76:369	3:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	75-76	72-73	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D007511	ischemic|ischemic	Disease	75:368	76:369	3:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	270-272	257-260	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D009202	cardiomyopathy|myocardial damage|myocardial injury	Disease	61:270:353	62:272:355	2:8:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	270-272	266-267	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D009202	cardiomyopathy|myocardial damage|myocardial injury	Disease	61:270:353	62:272:355	2:8:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	257-260	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D009203	myocardial infarct|myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|Myocardial infarction|MI	Disease	2:58:92:95:157:356	4:60:94:96:159:357	0:2:3:3:4:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	92-94	89-90	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D009203	myocardial infarct|myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|Myocardial infarction|MI	Disease	2:58:92:95:157:356	4:60:94:96:159:357	0:2:3:3:4:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	257-260	64-66	3553	interleukin - 1beta	Gene	257	260	7	D012772	septic shock	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	72-73	64-66	4843	iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS|iNOS	Gene	20:72:89:107:128:137:191:207:224:234:249:266:303:346	21:73:90:108:129:138:192:208:225:235:250:267:304:347	1:3:3:3:3:3:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	D012772	septic shock	Disease	64	66	2

10351920	The DD genotype of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene is negatively associated with right ventricular hypertrophy in male patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .|The renin angiotensin system plays an important role in the development of pulmonary artery remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy in hypoxia - induced pulmonary hypertension as may occur in patients with COPD .|Several polymorphisms of genes encoding for components of the renin angiotensin system such as the M235T polymorphism in the angiotensinogen gene , the 287 - base - pair insertion ( I ) / deletion ( D ) polymorphism at intron 16 of the ACE gene , and the A1166C polymorphism in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases .|With respect to the pulmonary circulation , only limited data exist on possible associations between polymorphisms of these genes and pulmonary hypertension and / or right ventricular hypertrophy .|The objective of the present study was to investigate a possible relationship between polymorphisms of the renin angiotensin system and electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy in patients with COPD .|We therefore determined the angiotensinogen ( M235T ) , angiotensin converting enzyme ( I / D ) , and angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( A1166C ) genotypes in 87 patients with severe COPD and correlated these data with electrocardiographic parameters of right ventricular hypertrophy .|Thirty - one patients ( 36 % ) of 87 patients with COPD showed electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy .|In the male , but not in the female , subgroup , the angiotensin - converting enzyme DD genotype was negatively associated with electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy ( male : chi2 = 3 . 8 , p = 0 . 05 ; female : chi2 = 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 82 ) .|We found no associations between the investigated polymorphisms in the

Online .|Marfan Syndrome ( MfS ) is an autosomal dominant inherited connective tissue disorder with variable phenotypic expression of cardiovascular , skeletal and ocular manifestations .|Cardiovascular complications , such as aortic aneurysm and dissection drastically reduce life expectancy of individuals with MfS , whereas preventive surgery substantially improves the prognosis of these patients .|A number of mutations in the fibrillin 1 ( FBN1 ) gene associated with MfS have been identified to date , demonstrating considerable molecular heterogeneity .|One region , however , located around exon 24 , exhibits a striking clustering of mutations , which are associated with a severe , socalled neonatal form of MfS .|Here we report the first mutation ( G2950A ) in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene , associated with a classic MfS phenotype .|The mutation leads to the subsitution of valin by isoleucin ( V984I ) , both uncharged amino acids , which only differ in a single methyl group .|This defect was identified in a proband with cardiovascular manifestations of MfS by SSCP analysis of PCR - amplified genomic DNA , direct PCR sequencing and RFLP analysis .|The substitution was neither detected in the unaffected 4 - year old daughter of the proband , nor in 3 of his healthy family members nor in 108 allels from control individuals , suggesting that this mutation is causative for MfS in the patient .|Since no other family member of the proband is affected by MfS , the defect described is sporadic .|In summary , we identified a novel defect in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene in a patient with a classic phenotype of MfS , suggesting that conservative substitutions in this region may lead to a less severe phenotype of the disease .|This finding further demonstrates the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity associated with FBN1 mutations and stresses the significance of modifying genes and individual alterations in protein function for the pheontypic expression of the disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	96-98	66-68	2200	fibrillin ( FBN ) 1|fibrillin 1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1	Gene	9:96:99:164:312:352	14:98:100:165:313:353	0:5:5:7:12:13	D001014	aortic aneurysm	Disease	66	68	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	96-98	61-63	2200	fibrillin ( FBN ) 1|fibrillin 1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1	Gene	9:96:99:164:312:352	14:98:100:165:313:353	0:5:5:7:12:13	D002318	Cardiovascular complications	Disease	61	63	4	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	104-105	99-100	2200	fibrillin ( FBN ) 1|fibrillin 1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1	Gene	9:96:99:164:312:352	14:98:100:165:313:353	0:5:5:7:12:13	D008382	Marfan syndrome|MfS|Marfan Syndrome|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS|MfS	Disease	21:24:36:39:77:104:144:171:213:271:287:322	23:25:38:40:78:105:145:172:214:272:288:323	0:0:3:3:4:5:6:7:9:10:11:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	45-49	9-14	2200	fibrillin ( FBN ) 1|fibrillin 1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1|FBN1	Gene	9:96:99:164:312:352	14:98:100:165:313:353	0:5:5:7:12:13	D030342	inherited connective tissue disorder	Disease	45	49	3

higher circulating levels of ACE , and increased risk of developing nephropathy in NIDDM .|The present study investigated the distribution of ACE gene genotypes in the general population and patients with NIDDM , the association between the D allele and diabetic nephropathy , and the association between the ACE genotype and involvement of other target organs in NIDDM .|The ACE genotype ( insertion

creatinine ratio of 30 mg / g or greater ( mean of 2 first morning urine samples ) .|In the general population most had the D allele ( DD or ID ) and a minority the II genotype .|There was no association between genotype and hypertension , ischemic heart disease , hyperlipidemia , and cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease .|In diabetics the genotype distribution was not different from that in the general population .|Within the diabetic group , there was no association between genotype and hypertension , hyperlipidemia , duration of diabetes , or HbA1C levels .|Nephropathy ,

11001912	An IL6 promoter polymorphism is associated with a lifetime risk of development of Kaposi sarcoma in men infected with human immunodeficiency virus .|Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) is an angioproliferative inflammatory condition that occurs commonly in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .|Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors promote the development of KS .|Because physiologically important cytokine polymorphisms modulate host inflammatory responses , we investigated the association between KS and common regulatory polymorphisms in 5 proinflammatory cytokine genes encoding interleukin ( IL ) IL - 1alpha , IL - 1beta , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha , TNF - beta , and IL - 6 and in the IL - 1 receptor antagonist ( IL1RN ) .|We also examined the contribution of stromal - derived factor 1 and chemokine receptor 5 ( Delta32 ) polymorphisms to KS development .|The population consisted of 115 HIV - infected men with KS and 126 deceased HIV - infected men without KS .|The only strong association was observed between an IL6 promoter polymorphism ( G - 174C ) and susceptibility to KS in HIV - infected men ( P = . 0035 ) .|Homozygotes for IL6 allele G , associated with increased IL6 production , were overrepresented among patients with KS ( P = . 0046 ) , whereas allele C homozygotes were underrepresented ( P = . 0062 ) .|Substantial in vitro evidence indicates that IL -

11176958	Genetic variation analysis in parkinson disease patients with and without hallucinations : case - control study .|BACKGROUND : Visual hallucinations in Parkinson disease ( PD ) occur in approximately one third of patients treated long - term with dopaminergic medications .|In Alzheimer disease , hallucinations and psychosis have been linked to increased representations of B2 / B2 homozyogotes for the dopamine receptor gene DRD1 and 1 / 1 or 2 / 2 homozygotes for DRD3 .|In addition , a previous study of PD patients with and without hallucinations did not show differences in D2 and D3 polymorphisms , although careful case - control matching was not performed .|Another study linked the apolipoprotein E4 ( APOE4 ) allele to hallucinations in PD .|OBJECTIVE : To determine whether the frequency of dopamine receptor genetic variants and APOE alleles in patients with PD with and without chronic visual hallucinations resembles the pattern previously documented in patients with Alzheimer disease .|METHODS : We conducted a case - control study of 44 patients with PD and chronic hallucinations and 44 patients with PD who had never hallucinated .|Cases and controls were matched for current age and medications .|DNA was isolated from blood samples and assayed for DRD1 , DRD2 , DRD3 , DRD4 , and APOE polymorphisms .|Receptor polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction .|Genotypes in hallucinators and nonhallucinators were compared using Mantel - Haenszel tests stratified by pair , and allele frequencies were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests within pairs .|RESULTS : Neither D1 receptor genotypes ( P = . 37 ) nor allele frequencies ( P = . 38 ) differed , and there was no predominance of B2 / B2 homozygotes in the hallucinators .|For D3 , there was a higher frequency of allele 2 ( P = . 047 ) , but there was no significant difference between frequencies of homozygotes vs heterozygotes ( P = . 39 ) as reported in Alzheimer disease .|D4 receptor distribution of long and short alleles did not differ between the 2 patient groups , and there were too few C alleles ( 3 of 86 ) to compare D2 allele genotypes or frequencies .|For APOE , 12 cases and 12 controls carried E4 alleles ( P > . 99 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : With careful case - control matching , visual hallucinations in PD are not associated with the pattern seen for patients with Alzheimer disease and visual hallucinations .|Furthermore , there was no association between hallucinations and APOE .|Similar methods using larger sample sizes might be adapted to test whether specific dopaminergic receptor genetic variants are associated with visual hallucinations in PD .|Based on our data , the DRD3 allele 2 may merit further study

switch recombination and antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) are unable to synthesize the NF - kappaB - regulated cytokines interleukin 12 ( IL - 12 ) or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) when stimulated with CD40L .|Nevertheless , innate immunity is preserved in XHM - ED patients because APCs retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 's antigen ( SAC ) .|Overall , the phenotype observed in XHM - ED patients shows that the putative zinc - finger domain of NEMO has a regulatory function and demonstrates the definite requirement of CD40 - mediated NF - kappaB activation for B cell immunoglobulin class - switching .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	83-86	80-82	1896	ectodermal dysplasia|ectodermal dysplasia	Gene	13:80	15:82	0:2	C536181	XHM -

with translocations .|We now report associations of MTHFR polymorphisms in three subgroups of pediatric leukemias : infant lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemias with MLL rearrangements and childhood lymphoblastic leukemias with either TEL - AML1 fusions or hyperdiploid karyotypes .|Pediatric leukemia patients ( n = 253 total ) and healthy newborn controls ( n = 200 ) were genotyped for MTHFR

associations may point to discrete attributes of the two alleles in their ability to alter folate and one - carbon metabolite pools and impact after DNA synthesis and methylation pathways , but should be viewed cautiously pending larger follow - up studies .|The data provide evidence that molecularly defined subgroups of pediatric leukemias have different etiologies and also suggest a role of

1 and the inducible COX - 2 .|COX - 2 is overexpressed in adenomas and colorectal cancers , and COX - 2 - specific inhibitors have been shown to inhibit intestinal polyps in Apc ( Delta716 ) mice more effectively than dual COX - 1 / COX - 2 inhibitors such as sulindac .|Various Apc knockout mice , including the multiple intestinal neoplasia ( Min ) mouse and the Apc ( Delta716 ) mouse , are limited by their lack of large numbers of colonic adenomas and aberrant crypt foci , the putative precursors of large - bowel polyps and cancers .|Our DNA mismatch - repair - deficient Min mouse model ( Apc + / - Msh2 - / - ) has genetic features of both familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer , and most importantly , rapidly develops numerous small - and large - bowel adenomas , as well as colonic aberrant crypt foci .|The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of COX inhibitors on intestinal adenomas and colonic aberrant crypt foci in this accelerated polyposis , mismatch - repair - deficient Min mouse model , in addition to a standard Min mouse model .|Weanling Apc + / - Msh2 - / - and Min mice were fed diets containing no drug , sulindac , or a specific COX - 2 inhibitor ( MF - tricyclic ) .|Apc + / - Msh2 - / - and Min mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and 5 months on diet , respectively .|Apc + / - Msh2 - / - mice treated with MF - tricyclic had significantly fewer small - bowel polyps ( mean + / - SD , 178 + / - 29 ) compared with mice on sulindac ( 278 + / - 80 ) , or control diet ( 341 + / - 43 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .|There was no difference in numbers of large - bowel polyps or aberrant crypt foci in mice in the three groups .|MF - tricyclic was also effective in reducing both small - and large - bowel polyps in Min mice .|Western analysis demonstrated COX - 2 expression in both large - and small - bowel polyps from mice of both genotypes .|This study demonstrates that a specific COX - 2 inhibitor is effective in preventing small - bowel polyps in mismatch - repair - deficient Min mice and both small - and large - bowel polyps in standard Min mice .|Therefore , specific COX - 2 inhibitors may be useful as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents in humans at risk for colorectal neoplasia .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	277-278	261-262	324	multiple intestinal neoplasia|multiple intestinal neoplasia|Min|Min|Min|Min|Min|Min|Min|Min|Min	Gene	14:147:151:196:277:286:300:333:451:500:513	17:150:152:197:278:287:301:334:452:501:514	0:5:5:6:7:7:8:9:12:14:14	D000236	adenomas|adenomas|adenomas	Disease	99:236:261	100:237:262	4:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	236-237	204-205	4436	Msh2|Msh2|Msh2|Msh2|Msh2	Gene	11:204:295:328:352	12:205:296:329:353	0:6:8:9:10	D000236	adenomas|adenomas|adenomas	Disease	99:236:261	100:237:262	4:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	99-100	83-86	4512	COX -

11732226	[ Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) and TNF - beta genes in men with disorders of spermatogenesis - - pilot study ] .|INTRODUCTION : The presence of components of the renin angiotensin system and tumour necrosis factor in a male reproductive tract supports the hypothesis that these substances may influence reproductive functions .|It was proved that angiotensin II as a product of ACE has influence on sperm capacitation and motility .|TNF - beta is released from T - lymphocytes and has the regulatory effect on steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis .|Aberrations of these agents can result in infertility .|OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to determine the allele frequency of ACE and TNF - beta genes in men with pathological sperm count and men with normal fertility .|We examined the insertion / deletion ( I / D ) ACE and B1 / B2 TNF - beta gene polymorphic alleles and analyzed their frequency in patients and fertile men .|DESIGN : A pilot study .|SETTING : 1st Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and Institute of Pathologic Physiology , Masaryk University , Brno , CR .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : The genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by a standard method according to Sambrook in a group of 46 patients ( 33 . 4 + / - 7 . 2 years ) with pathological sperm count ( 9 azoospermia , 21 severe oligoasthenospermia , 16 moderate oligoasthenospermia ) and in a control group of 88 healthy men ( 31 . 2 + / - 9 . 3 years ) with normal fertility .|Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was used for genom analysis .|The method according to Rigat was used for the I / D ACE polymorphism .|B1 / B2 TNF - beta genotype of each patient was determined after Nco I digestion of the amplified product and subsequent agrose gel electrophoresis .|Fisher 's exact test and chi square test were used for statistical analysis .|RESULTS : In the study we found these differences of allel frequency and their combination : 1 .|Combinations of the genotype II ( ACE ) + B1B2 ( TNF - beta ) and genotype II ( ACE ) + B2B2 ( TNF - beta ) were less frequent in patients ( 8 . 7 % ) than in fertile men ( 28 . 4 % ) , this difference was statistically significant ( p = 0 . 021 ) .|2 .|Allele B1 ( TNF - beta ) was more frequent among patients ( 40 . 2 % ) than in the control group ( 29 . 5 % ) , this difference was near to the point of statistical significance ( p = 0 . 05 ) .|3 .|Allele D ( ACE ) frequency was higher in men with pathological sperm count ( 52 . 2 % ) than in fertile men ( 44 . 9 % ) , this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0 . 15 ) .|CONCLUSION : The study has found different allele frequency of I / D ACE and B1 / B2 TNF - beta genes polymorphism in men with pathological sperm count compared to men with normal fertility .|These results could contribute to elucidate the genetic background of a male infertility .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	118-119	102-103	1636	angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	3:7:67:118:147:298:365:378:477:532	6:8:68:119:148:299:366:379:478:533	0:0:2:5:6:11:15:15:19:20	D007246	infertility	Disease	102	103	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	102-103	61-63	183	angiotensin II	Gene	61	63	2	D007246	infertility	Disease	102	103	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	149-152	102-103	3383	B1 / B2|B1 / B2|B1 / B2	Gene	149:301:534	152:304:537	6:12:20	D007246	infertility	Disease	102	103	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	149-152	102-103	931	B1 / B2|B1 / B2|B1 / B2	Gene	149:301:534	152:304:537	6:12:20	D007246	infertility	Disease	102	103	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	120-123	102-103	4049	TNF -

11787760	Brain - gut axis in gastroprotection by leptin and cholecystokinin against ischemia - reperfusion induced gastric lesions .|Leptin , a product of ob gene controlling food intake , has recently been detected in the stomach and shown to be released by CCK and implicated in gastroprotection against various noxious agents but it is unknown whether centrally applied leptin influences ischemia - reperfusion ( I / R ) - induced gastric erosions that progress into deeper gastric ulcerations .|In this study we compared the effects of leptin and CCK - 8 applied intracerebroventricularly ( i . c . v . ) or intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) on gastric mucosal lesions induced by I / R and topical application of 75 % ethanol .|Several major series of Wistar rats were used to examine the effects of leptin and CCK applied centrally on gastroprotection against I / R and ethanol in rats with A ) vagotomy by cutting of vagal nerves , B ) suppression of NO - synthase with L - NNA ( 20 mg / kg i . p . ) , C ) inactivation of sensory nerves by capsaicin ( 125 mg / kg s . c . ) and D ) inhibition of CGRP receptors with CGR ( 8 - 37 ) ( 100 microg / kg i . p . ) applied with or without the i . c . v .|pretreatment with leptin or CCK - 8 .|Rats were anesthetized 1 h after ethanol administration or at 3 h and 3 days upon the end of ischemia to measure the gastric blood flow ( GBF ) and then to determine the area of gastric lesions by planimetry .|Blood was withdrawn for the measurement of plasma leptin and gastrin levels by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) .|Leptin ( 0 . 1 - 20 microg / kg i . p . ) dose - dependently attenuated gastric lesions induced by 75 % ethanol and I / R ; the dose reducing these lesions by 50 % ( ED50 ) was 8 microg / kg and 6 microg / kg , respectively and this protective effect was similar to that obtained with CCK - 8 applied in a standard dose of 10 microg / kg i . p .|This protective effect of leptin was accompanied by a significant increase in GBF and plasma gastrin levels whereas CCK - 8 increased plasma leptin levels but failed to affect plasma gastrin levels .|Leptin and CCK - 8 applied i . c . v .|in a dose of 625 ng / rat reduced significantly the area of I / R induced gastric lesions and raised the GBF and plasma leptin levels with the extent similar to those achieved with peripheral administration of leptin or CCK - 8 ( 10 microg / kg i . p . ) .|The protective and hyperemic effects of centrally administered leptin or CCK - 8 ( 625 ng / rat i . c . v . ) were completely abolished by vagotomy and significantly attenuated by sensory denervation with capsaicin or by CGRP antagonist , CGRP ( 8 - 37 ) .|The pretreatment with L - NNA to inhibit NO - synthase activity attenuated significantly the protective and hyperemic effects of CCK but not those of leptin while capsaicin denervation counteracted leptin - induced protection and rise in the GBF but attenuated significantly those of CCK .|We conclude that : 1 ) central leptin exerts a potent gastroprotective activity against I / R - induced gastric erosions that progress into deeper gastric lesions and this protection depends upon vagal activity and sensory nerves and involves hyperemia probably mediated by NO and 2 ) leptin mimics the gastroprotective effect of CCK and may be implicated in the protective and hyperemic actions of this peptide against mucosal damage evoked by I / R .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	299-300	0-4	2520	gastrin|gastrin|gastrin	Gene	299:403:418	300:404:419	6:8:8	D001927	Brain - gut

11788685	A novel heterozygous mutation in peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma gene in a patient with familial partial lipodystrophy .|Familial partial lipodystrophies ( FPL ) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by marked loss of subcutaneous ( sc ) fat from the extremities .|Affected individuals show an increased preponderance of insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia .|Recently , lamin A / C gene mutations were found in patients with FPL , Dunnigan variety .|However , the genetic basis of other phenotypes remains unknown .|We studied peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPARgamma ) gene as a candidate gene in seven FPL patients who did not appear to have Dunnigan variety .|Analysis of the coding region of PPARG revealed C to T heterozygous mutation at nucleotide 1273 in exon 6 which changes a highly conserved residue , arginine at position 425 to cysteine ( R425C ) in the patient FX200 . 21 .|The patient is a 64 - year - old nonHispanic white woman who developed diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia at age 32 years and lipodystrophy of the extremities and face at age 50 years .|She also had hirsutism .|Anthropometry and whole body magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked loss of sc fat particularly from the extremities but sc truncal fat was slightly increased .|None of the four unaffected family members harbored the mutation .|We conclude that heterozygous , R425C , mutation in PPARG could be the molecular basis for one of the familial partial lipodystrophy phenotypes .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	58-60	55-56	3630	insulin	Gene	55	56	2	D003920	diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus	Disease	58:178	60:180	2:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	65-69	58-60	4000	lamin A / C	Gene	65	69	3	D003920	diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus	Disease	58:178	60:180	2:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	94-101	58-60	5468	peroxisome proliferator -

11792809	Properties of lamin A mutants found in Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy , cardiomyopathy and Dunnigan - type partial lipodystrophy .|Autosomal dominant Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene , which encodes lamin A and lamin C .|Mutations in this gene also give rise to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B , dilated cardiomyopathy with atrioventricular conduction defect and Dunnigan - type partial lipodystrophy .|The properties of the mutant lamins that cause muscular dystrophy , lipodystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy are not known .|We transfected C2C12 myoblasts with cDNA encoding wild -

11800584	Tumour necrosis factor alpha ( - 238 and - 308 ) and beta gene polymorphisms in pulmonary tuberculosis : haplotype analysis with HLA - A , B and DR genes .|SETTING : A study of tumour necrosis factor alpha and beta ( TNFalpha and beta ) gene polymorphism and haplotype analysis with HLA in pulmonary tuberculosis .|OBJECTIVE : To determine whether TNFalpha ( - 238 and - 308 ) and TNFbeta ( Nco I polymorphism in intron 2 ) genes either alone or in combination with human leucocyte antigens ( HLA ) as haplotypes afford susceptibility or resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis as well as bacteriological relapse of the disease .|DESIGN : Tumour necrosis factor alpha - 238 , - 308 ( TNFalpha - 238 , - 308 ) and TNFbeta ( Nco I ) gene polymorphisms were carried out in HLA - A , B and DR typed pulmonary tuberculosis patients ( n = 210 ) and 120 normal healthy control subjects .|RESULTS : No difference in the genotype frequencies of TNFalpha - 238 and - 308 and TNFbeta was seen between control subjects and pulmonary tuberculosis patients .|Of the HLA - TNF haplotypes analysed , the infrequent allele ( A ) of TNFalpha238 was in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA - A1 ( P corrected : Pc = 0 . 001 ) , B17 ( Pc < 0 . 0001 ) and DR7 ( Pc = 0 . 01 ) in control subjects and with B17 ( Pc < 0 . 0001 ) in pulmonary tuberculosis .|The infrequent allele 2 of TNFalpha - 308 and the infrequent allele 2 of TNFbeta were in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA - B21 .|An increased haplotype frequency of HLA - B17 - TNFalpha - 238 / A ( P = 0 . 05 ) , B17 - TNFalpha308 / 2 ( P = 0 . 03 ) and B17 - TNFalpha308 / 2 ( P = 0 . 01 ) was observed in bacteriological relapse patients than quiescent patients .|CONCLUSION : The present study suggests that TNFalpha ( - 238 and - 308 ) and TNFbeta gene variants are not associated independently with the susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis .|However , in combination with the HLA genes / gene products such as HLA - A1 , B17 , B21 and DR7 , the TNFalpha and beta genes as haplotypes are associated with protection against the disease as well as an increased susceptibility to bacteriological relapse .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	36-37	22-29	3105	HLA -

- > Ser ; PON2 * S ) polymorphism and the relationship between the PON2 * S allele and the other dementia risk factor , the apoE polymorphism in these dementias .|The PON2 * C and PON2 * S allele frequencies were similar in both AD ( 25 % and 75 % ) and VD groups ( 23 % and 77 % ) , respectively , compared with the controls ( 27 % and 73 % ) .|The ratio of the PON2 * S carriers was significantly higher among the apoE4 allele carrier AD ( 27 % ) and VD ( 25 % ) groups than in the control ( 12 % ) .|Our results indicate that the PON2 * S and apoE4 alleles have interactive effect on the development of the two most common forms of dementias AD and VD , and further support the hypothesis that cardiovascular factors contribute to the development of AD .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	270-271	267-268	348	apolipoprotein E4|apoE|apoE4|apoE4	Gene	18:201:267:300	20:202:268:301	0:1:3:4	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|AD|AD|AD|dementias AD|AD	Disease	143:147:221:270:315:333	146:148:222:271:317:334	1:1:2:3:4:4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	143-146	92-93	5444	PON|PON1|PON1|PON1	Gene	39:64:85:92	40:65:86:93	1:1:1:1	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|AD|AD|AD|dementias AD|AD	Disease	143:147:221:270:315:333	146:148:222:271:317:334	1:1:2:3:4:4	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	221-222	212-213	5445	paraoxonase -

11804665	Serum ceruloplasmin and ferroxidase activity are decreased in HFE C282Y homozygote male iron - overloaded patients .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : A body of evidence suggests that ceruloplasmin ( Cp ) , the major serum copper - containing protein , acts in iron metabolism due to its ferroxidase activity which appears essential for iron movements and exchanges .|METHODS : The present study investigated the serum levels of Cp and its ferroxidase activity in 53 C282Y homozygote genetic hemochromatosis ( 38 iron overloaded , 15 iron depleted ) patients as compared to age and sex - matched healthy volunteers .|RESULTS : Serum levels of Cp were significantly decreased in iron - overloaded male hemochromatotic patients vs . the control group ( P = 0 . 02 ) .|Furthermore , serum ferroxidase activity was strongly and significantly lower in iron - overloaded male hemochromatotic patients ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|In contrast , in iron - depleted male hemochromatotic patients , who were under maintenance therapy by regular phlebotomies , serum levels of Cp and ferroxidase activity were not statistically different from those observed in controls .|CONCLUSIONS : These data : ( i ) show that serum Cp and ferroxidase activity are decreased when C282Y homozygote men are iron overloaded and normal when iron depleted ; ( ii ) suggest that iron may modulate the Cp gene expression ; and ( iii ) raise the issue of the putative role of decreased serum ferroxidase activity in the phenotypic expression of HFE - 1 hereditary hemochromatosis .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	258-260	255-258	3077	HFE - 1	Gene	255	258	6	D006432	hemochromatosis|hereditary hemochromatosis	Disease	78:258	79:260	2:6

11926202	Hypertension after renal transplantation and polymorphism of genes involved in essential hypertension : ACE , AGT , AT1 R and ecNOS .|BACKGROUND : Arterial hypertension ( HT ) , secondary to cyclosporine A ( CsA ) used as main immunosuppressive treatment in renal transplantation ( RTx ) , is very frequent ( 70 % ) , usually severe and explained mostly by vasoconstriction of the glomerular afferent arteriole with secondary sodium and water retention .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : In a retrospective study , we have analyzed 294 consecutive recipients receiving a first renal cadaveric allograft and all treated with CsA ( the majority with triple therapy ) .|We studied , by molecular biology , the polymorphism of genes previously implicated in essential HT such as : angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE : II , ID and DD ) , angiotensinogen ( AGT : MM , MT and TT ) , angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1 - R : AA , AC and CC ) and endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase ( ecNOS : aa , ab and bb ) , and correlated the data to the prevalence and severity of post - Tx HT .|This cohort included 195 ( 66 % ) males and 99 females with a mean age of 42 years at time of Tx .|The presence and severity of post - Tx HT were indicated by initial persistent blood pressure over 140 / 90 mmHg with the need for at least one anti - hypertensive drug and by the number of anti - HT medications required to achieve its control .|RESULTS : The distribution of the specific alleles and genotypes for ACE , AGT , AT1 - R , and ecNOS was not different in transplant recipients compared to 181 controls .|At 5 years post - Tx , the prevalence of HT was 72 % ( 169 out of 235 ) among functioning grafts .|There was no significant difference for ACE , AGT , AT1R and ecNOS genotypes distribution between hypertensive vs non - HT recipients .|The number of anti - hypertensive drugs prescribed was not different among ACE , AGT , and AT1 - R genotypes .|However , the a allele and the non - bb genotype ( aa + ab ) for ecNOS were significantly ( p = 0 . 001 ) associated with a less severe HT , needing fewer anti - HT drugs .|At 10 years post - Tx , the HT prevalence remained high 78 % ( 67 out of 86 ) among functioning Tx .|However , the limited numbers did not allow further correlation .|CONCLUSIONS : This study produced mainly negative results except for ecNOS - a allele , which seems to protect against severe hypertension .|The explanation remains speculative but probably relates to the known cyclosporine - induced upregulation of ecNOS gene and enzyme activity .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	140-141	134-135	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	13:134:283:334:363	14:135:284:335:364	0:3:6:8:9	C536170	DD	Disease	140	141	3	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	143-144	140-141	183	AGT|angiotensinogen|AGT|AGT|AGT|AGT	Gene	15:143:145:285:336:365	16:144:146:286:337:366	0:3:3:6:8:9	C536170	DD	Disease	140	141	3	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-159	140-141	185	AT1|angiotensin II type 1 receptor|AT1 -

these patients were matched with 226 patients with CAD without CA ( control group ) .|The - 1 , 306 C / T MMP - 2 , 5A / 6A MMP - 3 , CA - repeat MMP - 9 and - 82 A / G MMP - 12 polymorphisms were determined .|RESULTS : The MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 12 polymorphisms were not associated with CA .|By contrast , the 5A / 5A genotype of MMP - 3 was significantly more frequent in the CA group than in the control group ( 31 % vs . 18 % , p = 0 . 015 ) ; similarly , the MMP - 3 5A allele was more frequent in the CA group ( p = 0 . 009 ) .|Three variables were independently associated with CA : the MMP - 3 5A / 5A genotype ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 23 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] [ 1 . 27 to 3 . 93 ] ) , a previous myocardial infarction ( OR = 1 . 91 , 95 % CI [ 1 . 14 to 3 . 20 ] ) and a history of aortic aneurysm ( OR = 21 . 06 , 95 % CI [ 2 . 35 to 188 ] ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The MMP - 3 5A allele is associated with the occurrence of CA .|Our results suggest that an increased proteolysis in the arterial wall may act as a susceptibility factor for the development of CA in patients with coronary atherosclerosis .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	174-177	112-113	4313	MMP - 2|MMP - 2|MMP - 2	Gene	6:174:207	9:177:210	0:5:6	D000783	aneurysm	Disease	112	113	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	181-184	112-113	4314	MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3	Gene	10:181:234:268:297:385	13:184:237:271:300:388	0:5:7:7:8:9	D000783	aneurysm	Disease	112	113	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	188-191	112-113	4318	MMP - 9|MMP - 9|MMP - 9	Gene	14:188:211	17:191:214	0:5:6	D000783	aneurysm	Disease	112	113	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	197-200	112-113	4321	MMP - 12|MMP - 12|MMP - 12	Gene	18:197:215	21:200:218	0:5:6	D000783	aneurysm	Disease	112	113	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	361-363	207-210	4313	MMP - 2|MMP - 2|MMP - 2	Gene	6:174:207	9:177:210	0:5:6	D001014	aortic aneurysm	Disease	361	363	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	385-388	361-363	4314	MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3	Gene	10:181:234:268:297:385	13:184:237:271:300:388	0:5:7:7:8:9	D001014	aortic aneurysm	Disease	361	363	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	361-363	211-214	4318	MMP - 9|MMP - 9|MMP - 9	Gene	14:188:211	17:191:214	0:5:6	D001014	aortic aneurysm	Disease	361	363	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	361-363	215-218	4321	MMP - 12|MMP - 12|MMP - 12	Gene	18:197:215	21:200:218	0:5:6	D001014	aortic aneurysm	Disease	361	363	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	25-29	6-9	4313	MMP - 2|MMP - 2|MMP - 2	Gene	6:174:207	9:177:210	0:5:6	D003323	aneurysmal coronary artery disease|coronary aneurysms|CAs	Disease	25:54:57	29:56:58	0:1:1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	25-29	10-13	4314	MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3	Gene	10:181:234:268:297:385	13:184:237:271:300:388	0:5:7:7:8:9	D003323	aneurysmal coronary artery disease|coronary aneurysms|CAs	Disease	25:54:57	29:56:58	0:1:1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	25-29	14-17	4318	MMP - 9|MMP - 9|MMP - 9	Gene	14:188:211	17:191:214	0:5:6	D003323	aneurysmal coronary artery disease|coronary aneurysms|CAs	Disease	25:54:57	29:56:58	0:1:1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	25-29	18-21	4321	MMP - 12|MMP - 12|MMP - 12	Gene	18:197:215	21:200:218	0:5:6	D003323	aneurysmal coronary artery disease|coronary aneurysms|CAs	Disease	25:54:57	29:56:58	0:1:1	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	174-177	158-159	4313	MMP - 2|MMP - 2|MMP - 2	Gene	6:174:207	9:177:210	0:5:6	D003324	coronary artery disease|CAD|CAD|CAD|coronary atherosclerosis	Disease	91:95:139:158:423	94:96:140:159:425	2:2:4:4:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	181-184	158-159	4314	MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3	Gene	10:181:234:268:297:385	13:184:237:271:300:388	0:5:7:7:8:9	D003324	coronary artery disease|CAD|CAD|CAD|coronary atherosclerosis	Disease	91:95:139:158:423	94:96:140:159:425	2:2:4:4:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	188-191	158-159	4318	MMP - 9|MMP - 9|MMP - 9	Gene	14:188:211	17:191:214	0:5:6	D003324	coronary artery disease|CAD|CAD|CAD|coronary atherosclerosis	Disease	91:95:139:158:423	94:96:140:159:425	2:2:4:4:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	197-200	158-159	4321	MMP - 12|MMP - 12|MMP - 12	Gene	18:197:215	21:200:218	0:5:6	D003324	coronary artery disease|CAD|CAD|CAD|coronary atherosclerosis	Disease	91:95:139:158:423	94:96:140:159:425	2:2:4:4:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	335-337	207-210	4313	MMP - 2|MMP - 2|MMP - 2	Gene	6:174:207	9:177:210	0:5:6	D009203	myocardial infarction	Disease	335	337	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	335-337	297-300	4314	MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3|MMP - 3	Gene	10:181:234:268:297:385	13:184:237:271:300:388	0:5:7:7:8:9	D009203	myocardial infarction	Disease	335	337	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	335-337	211-214	4318	MMP - 9|MMP - 9|MMP - 9	Gene	14:188:211	17:191:214	0:5:6	D009203	myocardial infarction	Disease	335	337	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	335-337	215-218	4321	MMP - 12|MMP - 12|MMP - 12	Gene	18:197:215	21:200:218	0:5:6	D009203	myocardial infarction	Disease	335	337	8

12163415	Rescue of cleft palate in Msx1 - deficient mice by transgenic Bmp4 reveals a network of BMP and Shh signaling in the regulation of mammalian palatogenesis .|Cleft palate , the most frequent congenital craniofacial birth defects in humans , arises from genetic or environmental perturbations in the multi - step process of palate development .|Mutations in the MSX1 homeobox gene are associated with non - syndromic cleft palate and tooth agenesis in humans .|We have used Msx1 - deficient mice as a model system that exhibits severe craniofacial abnormalities , including cleft secondary palate and lack of teeth , to study the genetic regulation of mammalian palatogenesis .|We found that Msx1 expression was restricted to the anterior of the first upper molar site in the palatal mesenchyme and that Msx1 was required for the expression of Bmp4 and Bmp2 in the mesenchyme and Shh in the medial edge epithelium ( MEE ) in the same region of developing palate .|In vivo and in vitro analyses indicated that the cleft palate seen in Msx1 mutants resulted from a defect in cell proliferation in the anterior palatal mesenchyme rather than a failure in palatal fusion .|Transgenic expression of human Bmp4 driven by the mouse Msx1 promoter in the Msx1 ( - / - ) palatal mesenchyme rescued the cleft palate phenotype and neonatal lethality .|Associated with the rescue of the cleft palate was a restoration of Shh and Bmp2 expression , as well as a return of cell proliferation to the normal levels .|Ectopic Bmp4 appears to bypass the requirement for Msx1 and functions upstream of Shh and Bmp2 to support palatal development .|Further in vitro assays indicated that Shh ( normally expressed in the MEE ) activates Bmp2 expression in the palatal mesenchyme which in turn acts as a mitogen to stimulate cell division .|Msx1 thus controls a genetic hierarchy involving BMP and Shh signals that regulates the growth of the anterior region of palate during mammalian palatogenesis .|Our findings provide insights into the cellular and molecular etiology of the non -

12241105	Identification of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) polymorphisms in brain tumors and association with susceptibility to pediatric astrocytomas .|Polymorphisms in the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) genes , a superfamily that plays a key role in carcinogen metabolism , have been associated with an increased susceptibility to several types of cancer .|We wished to evaluate whether variant allelic forms of GST isoenzymes were associated with an increased susceptibility for brain tumors and age of tumor onset .|Here , we examined 394 brain tumors ( 221 adult and 173 pediatric cases consisting of 197 astrocytic and 197 non - astrocytic tumors ) to determine the frequency of polymorphisms in the GSTM1 , GSTT1 , and GSTP1 genes compared to a healthy control population .|Our data shows that the frequency of GST polymorphisms varies not only between adult and pediatric patients with brain tumors and healthy controls , but also between different histological subtypes of brain tumors occurring in pediatric patients .|We found ( i ) a statistically significant increase in the frequency of the functional GSTM1 allele in high - grade pediatric astrocytomas ( p < 0 . 002 ) , ( ii ) a significant increase in the frequency of the rare GSTP1 variant Val114 / Val114 in pediatric astrocytomas ( p < 0 . 002 ) , and ( iii ) a significant increase in the frequency of the rare GSTP1 Val114 / Val114 genotype among pediatric tumors showing microsatellite instability ( MSI ) due to defects in mismatch repair ( MMR ) proteins ( p = 0 . 003 ) .|Our results suggest that GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms may play a role in brain tumor susceptibility by histological subtype , particularly high - grade pediatric astrocytomas .|Moreover , the presence of the genetic modifier GSTP1 Val114 / Val14 genotype may begin to define a high - risk genotype for cancer susceptibility in the pediatric population .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	190-191	183-184	2944	GSTM1|GSTM1|GSTM1	Gene	116:183:276	117:184:277	3:5:6	D001254	astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas	Disease	19:190:218:297	20:191:219:298	0:5:5:6	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	218-219	211-212	2950	GSTP1|GSTP1|GSTP1|GSTP1|GSTP1	Gene	121:211:240:278:307	122:212:241:279:308	3:5:5:6:7	D001254	astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas	Disease	19:190:218:297	20:191:219:298	0:5:5:6	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	190-191	118-119	2952	GSTT1	Gene	118	119	3	D001254	astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas|astrocytomas	Disease	19:190:218:297	20:191:219:298	0:5:5:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	24-28	19-20	373156	glutathione S -

12356632	Angiotensin - converting enzyme genotype modulates pulmonary function and exercise capacity in treated patients with congestive stable heart failure .|BACKGROUND : The gene encoding ACE exhibits an insertion / deletion polymorphism resulting in 3 genotypes ( DD , ID , and II ) , which affects serum and tissue ACE activity as well as other vasoactive substances .|Pulmonary function is frequently abnormal in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , the mechanism of which has not been completely characterized .|ACE inhibition has been shown to improve diffusion across the alveolar - capillary membrane and to improve exercise capacity and gas exchange in CHF .|The aim of the current study was to determine if ACE genotype is associated with altered pulmonary function and exercise intolerance in patients with treated CHF .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Fifty - seven patients ( stratified according to ACE genotype as 17 DD , 28 ID , 12 II ) with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy , left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) < 35 % , and < 10 pack - years of smoking history were studied .|All patients were receiving standard therapy for left ventricular systolic dysfunction .|Pulmonary function , LVEF , serum ACE , plasma angiotensin II , atrial natriuretic peptide , and brain natriuretic peptide were measured at baseline .|Peak VO2 and gas exchange measurements were assessed with graded exercise .|Resting LVEF was similar among the genotype groups ( 25 % to 28 % ) , and no differences were observed in diastolic function or pulmonary artery pressures ( P > 0 . 05 ) .|Mean peak VO2 and forced vital capacity ( % Pred ) were significantly reduced ( P < 0 . 05 ) , whereas mean serum ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration were highest in DD homozygotes .|Subjects homozygous for the D - allele also demonstrated higher mean ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide ( VE / VCO2 ) during exercise ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : ACE DD genotype is associated with decreased exercise tolerance in CHF , possibly mediated by altered pulmonary function .|Pharmacological strategies effecting more complete inhibition of serum and tissue ACE and / or potentiation of bradykinin may improve exercise capacity in patients with CHF and ACE DD genotype .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	346-347	345-346	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	25:50:84:119:148:207:299:345:374:390	26:51:85:120:149:208:300:346:375:391	1:1:3:4:5:7:10:12:13:13	C536170	DD|DD|DD|DD|DD	Disease	37:152:309:346:391	38:153:310:347:392	1:5:10:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	309-310	303-305	183	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Gene	210:303	212:305	7:10	C536170	DD|DD|DD|DD|DD	Disease	37:152:309:346:391	38:153:310:347:392	1:5:10:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	391-392	380-381	3827	bradykinin	Gene	380	381	13	C536170	DD|DD|DD|DD|DD	Disease	37:152:309:346:391	38:153:310:347:392	1:5:10:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	163-165	148-149	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	25:50:84:119:148:207:299:345:374:390	26:51:85:120:149:208:300:346:375:391	1:1:3:4:5:7:10:12:13:13	D002311	dilated cardiomyopathy	Disease	163	165	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	210-212	163-165	183	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Gene	210:303	212:305	7:10	D002311	dilated cardiomyopathy	Disease	163	165	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	380-381	163-165	3827	bradykinin	Gene	380	381	13	D002311	dilated cardiomyopathy	Disease	163	165	5	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	390-391	388-389	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	25:50:84:119:148:207:299:345:374:390	26:51:85:120:149:208:300:346:375:391	1:1:3:4:5:7:10:12:13:13	D006333	heart failure|congestive heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	17:67:71:107:134:355:388	19:70:72:108:135:356:389	0:2:2:3:4:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	355-356	303-305	183	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Gene	210:303	212:305	7:10	D006333	heart failure|congestive heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	17:67:71:107:134:355:388	19:70:72:108:135:356:389	0:2:2:3:4:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	388-389	380-381	3827	bradykinin	Gene	380	381	13	D006333	heart failure|congestive heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	17:67:71:107:134:355:388	19:70:72:108:135:356:389	0:2:2:3:4:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	161-162	148-149	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	25:50:84:119:148:207:299:345:374:390	26:51:85:120:149:208:300:346:375:391	1:1:3:4:5:7:10:12:13:13	D007511	ischemic	Disease	161	162	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	210-212	161-162	183	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Gene	210:303	212:305	7:10	D007511	ischemic	Disease	161	162	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	380-381	161-162	3827	bradykinin	Gene	380	381	13	D007511	ischemic	Disease	161	162	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	207-208	196-200	1636	ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	25:50:84:119:148:207:299:345:374:390	26:51:85:120:149:208:300:346:375:391	1:1:3:4:5:7:10:12:13:13	D018487	left ventricular systolic dysfunction	Disease	196	200	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	210-212	196-200	183	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Gene	210:303	212:305	7:10	D018487	left ventricular systolic dysfunction	Disease	196	200	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	380-381	196-200	3827	bradykinin	Gene	380	381	13	D018487	left ventricular systolic dysfunction	Disease	196	200	6
